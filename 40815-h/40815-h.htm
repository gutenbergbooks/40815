<h2>EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>The history of prices is one of the most interesting
subjects that can engage research. As language
has been called fossil poetry, from which the primitive
workings of the mind of man may be elicited,
so the story of his progress in material well-being
lies enfolded in the history of the prices which have
at various periods been procurable for commodities,
whether of prime necessity, of general utility,
or simply ornamental. The prices of books, so ably
investigated and recorded by Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheatley</span> in
the following pages, are a small but significant department
of a great subject. If we had no record
of the price of any other article of commerce,
we should still perceive in them an index to the
world’s advance in wealth, taste, and general intelligence.
With every allowance for the fall in the
value of money, it would yet be manifest that prices
could now be afforded for books which at an earlier
period would have been out of the question; and
not less so that while some classes of books had risen
in worth with the enhanced standard of wealth,
others had accommodated themselves to the requirements
of the poor. We should trace the effect
of mechanical improvements in diminishing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
prices of things, and of fashion and curiosity in
augmenting them. We should see the enormous
influence of scarcity in forcing up the value of
products, while we should learn at the same time
that this was not the sole agent, but that intrinsic
merit must usually to some extent co-operate with
it, and that prices must bear some relation to the
inherent reason of things. It must, for instance,
have been entirely unforeseen by the early printers
that the books which they advertised with such
exultation as cheaper than the manuscripts they
were superseding would in process of time become
dearer, but we can discern this metamorphosis of
relative value to have been rational and inevitable.
Finally, the fluctuations of price would afford a clue
to the intellectual condition of the age. Observing,
for example, the great decline which, as a rule,
has taken place in the value of early editions of the
classics, we should conclude that either the classical
writers were less generally esteemed than formerly,
or that such progress had been made in their study
that the old editions had become inadequate; and
both conclusions would be well founded.</p>

<p>Books occupy a middle position between ordinary
products and works of art. Like the latter,
they are in theory the offspring of an exceptional
talent. The humblest bookman views himself as
in some measure the superior of his readers for
the time being; he would have no excuse for addressing
them if he did not suppose himself able
to convey to them some pleasure which they could
not have attained without him, or to inform them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
of something, however insignificant, which but for
him would have remained unknown. But whereas
in the arts price is usually in the ratio of the real or
supposed intellectual merit of the production, in
books it may almost be said that the reverse rule
obtains. The fine picture or statue cannot be reproduced
as an original work; copies may be made
to any extent, but no amount of copying impairs
the value of the unique original. Again, such a
work, whether absolutely perfect or not, once
finished is complete for all time, and allows of no
further improvement. But the book admits of indefinite
multiplication, and the extent to which this
proceeds is commonly in the ratio of its intellectual
worth. It is the very greatest authors, the Homers,
the Shakespeares, that are usually the easiest and
cheapest to procure.</p>

<p>It appears, therefore, that, although great books
unquestionably demand more intellectual power
for their production than great works of art, their
very superiority tends to cheapen them in comparison
by encouraging their dissemination. There
could not be a stronger instance of the power of
scarcity in determining price; and, in fact, the
rarity of a book is the most important element in
its commercial worth. Yet intrinsic desert plays
its part, though an inferior one. There are some
cases in which it utterly fails. The commercial
value of the productions of the Dutch prototypographers,
for example, would probably not be augmented
in the least if they could be transformed
from fragments of dull lesson-books into leaves from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
sages and poets. The Papal Bulls relating to the
Turks in Cyprus, which have the honour to be
the first documents to have issued complete from
an European press, would hardly gain in commercial
value if they were briefs announcing the
foundation of the Vatican Library, or official announcements
of the fall of Constantinople. On the
other hand, the first edition of Virgil, one of the
rarest of books, would assuredly be less valued if,
while equally rare, it were the <i>editio princeps</i> of a
Latin author of inferior reputation. In general, the
celebrity of an author will be found a considerable
factor in determining the value of a book; but
while rarity without celebrity will effect much, celebrity
without rarity, or some other adventitious
circumstance devoid of relation to the intellectual
value of the book, will effect very little.</p>

<p>Many other circumstances besides scarcity will
contribute to render a book highly prized, and consequently
dear. Some of these are obvious at once,
such as fine paper, fine print, fine binding, or the
autograph of a celebrated man. A book will be
valued because it has been the subject of a judicial
condemnation, or because it is a copy containing a
plate in general deficient or mutilated, or perhaps
only because it has an erratum corrected in other
copies. Mr. Sidney Lee’s recent discovery of a
unique peculiarity in the Baroness Burdett-Coutts’
Shakespeare folio may probably have doubled the
value of the book. Sometimes such causes are
very singular. King Charles the First dropped a
pamphlet into the mud; the stain remains to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
day, and centuples the value of a tract which would
have been only deteriorated if it had slipped from
the fingers of a lord-in-waiting. Such a fact introduces
the element of sentiment, a powerful factor,
and one of far-reaching influence; for the Quaker
or Freemason who collects literature interesting to
his society, or the local patriot who buys up the
books printed in his native town, sets others upon
collecting them too, and raises the value all round.
Next to scarcity and great beauty, nothing, perhaps,
imparts such stability to the worth of a book as to
be addressed to a small but well-defined circle of
readers. Books on chess and angling are familiar
instances. They are not too numerous to dismay
a collector, and every one differs from the rest in
some feature sufficient to make it indispensable to
a collector ambitious of completeness.</p>

<p>A certain description of books would excite lively
interest if they could be identified with certainty,
those which are not valuable now, but which are
about to be. It may probably be considered that
almost any book which can manage to exist for
five hundred years will find itself augmented in
value at the end of this period, but some classes
will have proved much better investments than
others. Two may be signalised with considerable
confidence&mdash;illustrated books, which portray the
fashions and humours of the age for posterity, and
newspapers. Nothing grows in value like a newspaper;
the sheets of to-day, which, perhaps, contain
nothing of interest to any contemporary reader,
will be priceless to the historian and antiquary of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
the centuries to come. They fructify in silence,
and imperceptibly make their possessor rich. Their
intellectual as well as their pecuniary value augments
by lying still. Nothing so faithfully depicts
an age for its successors; they are worth all the
histories and all the novels. Their preservation&mdash;which
involves their assemblage in one place for
the sake of accessibility and of comparison with
each other and with books&mdash;is a momentous trust,
neglect of which would strike a heavy blow at historical,
archæological, and sociological research, and
inflict a grievous injury upon the ages to come.</p>

<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>The subject of the prices of books is one which
always exercises a certain fascination over the minds
of book-lovers, although some have expressed their
objection to any discussion of it, lest this should
have the effect of enhancing prices.</p>

<p>In a single volume it is impossible to deal with
so large a subject in any fulness of detail, and I
have therefore endeavoured to give a general view,
merely instancing a few cases in illustration of the
whole, but making an exception in respect of two
of the most interesting and high-priced classes of
books in literature, namely, the productions of the
press of Caxton, and the original editions of Shakespeare’s
works.</p>

<p>It is necessary for the reader to bear two points
in <span class="lock">mind&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(1) That the value of money has changed during
each century of our history to an extent not easy
to calculate with precision, because the prices of all
articles have not been equally affected. We can say
generally that definite incomes a hundred years ago
were equivalent in worth to twice their nominal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
amount at the present day, and that those of two
hundred years ago would be worth about five times
as much. In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries
money was worth ten or twelve times what it is
now, but there is some difficulty in calculating
correctly the rates respectively of necessaries and
luxuries. This is a matter for experts, and cannot
be more than alluded to here, as a warning to the
reader that he must always remember that a pound
or a shilling in previous centuries was of more value
than it is to-day, and possessed a much greater
purchasing power.</p>

<p>(2) That in dealing with prices we are interested
with rare and specially valuable books. Ordinary
standard books, even in good editions, were never
cheaper than at present.</p>

<p>A writer of a work of this kind must feel grateful
to predecessors, who have made it possible for him
to gather satisfactory material for his purpose.
Special gratitude is due to Thomas Frognall Dibdin,
Hartwell Horne, and William Clarke (author
of the <i>Repertorium Bibliographicum</i>), who were all
thorough workers in this field. The labours of
Dibdin have been unjustly depreciated by many
modern writers. His works, besides being among
the most beautiful books produced in Europe,
are mines of bibliographical anecdote and useful
literary information. Objections may be made
by some to his descriptions, but he certainly greatly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
influenced the bibliomania of a former age, and
made many sales famous which otherwise would
have been forgotten except by the few.</p>

<p>There is a gap in the literature of our subject
between authors at the beginning of the century
and the modern writers, who largely obtain their
information from French sources.</p>

<span class="smaller">INTRODUCTION</span></h2>


<p>The treatment of such a subject as the Prices of
Books necessarily obliges us to range over a wide
field, for books have been bought and sold far back
in the historical period, and to books, both manuscript
and printed, we have to refer largely for
records of the past. It is, however, only possible
in the space at our disposal to take a very general
view of the subject; and it is to be hoped that,
in recording the main points in the vicissitudes
of prices, the information may not be deemed too
desultory to be serviceable.</p>

<p>We might go back to the earliest times, even
to Job’s famous exclamation, but for our present
purpose there would not be much advantage in
roaming in this early period, as the results to be
recorded would partake more of an archæological,
than of a practical character. There is very little
chance of a copy of the first book of Martial’s
Epigrams (which, when first composed by the
author, cost at Rome about three shillings and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
sixpence of our money) coming to auction, so that
we are not likely to be able to record its present
value.</p>

<p>A consideration of the subject opens up a large
number of interesting subjects, which can only
casually be alluded to, such as the position of
authors, and their remuneration.</p>

<p>For several centuries monasteries were the chief
producers of literature, and it seems probable that
it was worth the while of the chiefs of some of
these literary manufactories to pay a poet such as
Chaucer something for a new Canterbury Tale,
which they could copy and distribute over the
country. We know by the number of manuscripts,
and the different order in these, that
several establishments were employed in the production
of the manuscripts, and we may guess
that there would probably be competition among
them, which would naturally result in a settlement
of some terms of payment.</p>

<p>In the early times it was only rich men who
could afford to collect books. Amongst these, one
of the most distinguished was Richard de Bury,
Bishop of Durham, Treasurer and Chancellor of
Edward III., who collected everything, and spared
no cost in the maintenance of a staff of copyists
and illuminators in his own household. Not only
was he a collector (whose books, however, have been
dispersed), but he was the author of an interesting
relic of that devotion to an ennobling pursuit, the
famous <i>Philobiblon</i>. This book had never been
satisfactorily produced until the late Mr. Ernest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
Thomas issued in 1888 an admirable edition, founded
on a collation of many manuscripts, and a spirited
translation.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> This work occupied Mr. Thomas
several years, and before he completed it he saw
reason to doubt the high literary position which
had been universally accorded to the author; and
his opinion was confirmed by an unpublished passage
in a manuscript of the <i>Chronicon sui temporis</i>
of Adam de Murimuth, to which he was referred
by Sir Edward Maunde Thompson, where Adam
characterised the bishop in very harsh terms. Mr.
Thomas published in “The Library” (vol. i. p. 335)
an article entitled, “Was Richard de Bury an
Impostor?” In this he expressed the opinion that
Richard <span class="lock">Aungerville&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockhang">

<p class="hang">(1) Was <i>not</i> an excellent bishop, <i>but</i> an ambitious self-seeker,
who bought his way to preferment.</p>

<p class="hang">(2) Was <i>not</i> a scholar and patron of scholars, <i>but</i> merely
a collector of books, that he might appear as a
scholar.</p>

<p class="hang">(3) <i>Did not</i> bestow his collections on Durham College,
Oxford, as he expressed his intention of doing;
<i>but</i> that these collections were sold to pay debts
incurred by his ostentatious extravagance.</p>

<p class="hang">(4) <i>Did not</i> write <i>Philobiblon</i>. The authorship was
claimed for Robert Holkot, a Dominican, who for
some time was a member of the bishop’s household.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>It is certain that the evidence is such as to force
us to lower our estimate of the prelate’s merits, but
these four charges are certainly not all proved. He
may not have been so learned and so unselfish a
lover of books as was supposed, but there is no
satisfactory reason for depriving him of the credit
of being the author of the <i>Philobiblon</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Thomas shows that Richard de Bury was
born on 24th January 1287, and not 1281, as stated
in the “Dictionary of National Biography.” He
completed the <i>Philobiblon</i>, and on the 14th April of
the same year <i>Dominus Ricardus de Bury migravit
ad Dominum</i>.</p>

<p>A singularly appropriate chapter from the earliest
“book about books” may here be <span class="lock">quoted:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="title">“<span class="smcap">What we are to Think of the Price in The
Buying of Books.</span>
<br />
(Chapter III. of the <i>Philobiblon</i> of Richard de Bury.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a>)</p>

<p>“From what has been said we draw this corollary,
welcome to us, but (as we believe) acceptable to few;
namely, that no dearness of price ought to hinder a man
from the buying of books, if he has the money that is
demanded for them, unless it be to withstand the malice
of the seller, or to await a more favourable opportunity of
buying. For if it is wisdom only that makes the price of
books, which is an infinite treasure to mankind, and if the
value of books is unspeakable, as the premises show, how
shall the bargain be shown to be dear where an infinite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
good is being bought? Wherefore that books are to be
gladly bought and unwillingly sold, Solomon, the sun of
men, exhorts in the <i>Proverbs:</i> <i>Buy the truth</i>, he says, <i>and
sell not wisdom</i>. But what we are trying to show by
rhetoric or logic, let us prove by examples from history.
The arch-philosopher Aristotle, whom Averroes regards as
the law of Nature, bought a few books of Speusippus
straightway after his death for seventy-two thousand
sesterces. Plato, before him in time, but after him in
learning, bought the book of Philolaus the Pythagorean,
from which he is said to have taken the <i>Timæus</i>, for ten
thousand denaries, as Aulus Gellius relates in the <i>Noctes
Atticæ</i>. Now Aulus Gellius relates this that the foolish
may consider how wise men despise money in comparison
with books. And on the other hand, that we may know
that folly and pride go together, let us here relate the folly
of Tarquin the Proud in despising books, as also related
by Aulus Gellius. An old woman, utterly unknown, is
said to have come to Tarquin the Proud, the seventh King
of Rome, offering to sell nine books in which (as she declared)
sacred oracles were contained; but she asked an
immense sum for them, insomuch that the king said she
was mad. In anger she flung three books into the fire, and
still asked the same price for the rest. When the king
refused it, again she flung three others into the fire, and
still asked the same price for the three that were left. At
last, astonished beyond measure, Tarquin was glad to pay
for three books the same price for which he might have
bought nine. The old woman straightway disappeared,
and was never seen before or after. These were the Sibylline
books....”</p></div>

<p>The destruction of libraries, which was common
in the Middle Ages, naturally caused an increase in
the value of those which remained. How completely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
these libraries passed away may be seen by the
instance of that which was once preserved in St.
Paul’s Cathedral, and is noticed by the late Dr.
Sparrow Simpson in his “St. Paul’s Cathedral
Library” (1893). Walter Shiryngton Clerk founded
the library, the catalogue of which (1458) fills eight
folio pages in the first edition of Dugdale’s “History
of St. Paul’s.” Of all the manuscripts in this catalogue,
only three are now known to exist: one is
still at St. Paul’s, the second is at Aberdeen, and the
third at Lambeth.</p>

<p>The British Museum is fortunate in possessing
the beautiful library of the Kings and Queens of
England since Henry VII., which is full of the most
splendid specimens of artistic bindings. What the
market value of such literary gems as these may be
can scarcely be estimated, and fortunately they are
safe from the arising of any occasion which might
afford a test of their value. From this library we
are able to appreciate the good taste of James I.,
who, whatever his faults may have been, was certainly
a true bibliophile, and to him we owe some
of the finest books in the collection.</p>

<p>It may be safely said that few collections of books
have been formed under such difficult and trying
circumstances as the invaluable Thomason Collection
of Civil War Tracts, now happily preserved in
the British Museum. Mr. F. Madan has contributed
to <i>Bibliographica</i> (vol. iii. p. 291) a most valuable
article on the labours of the worthy Royalist
bookseller, George Thomason. Thomason commenced
in November 1640, when the “Long or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Rebel Parliament” began, his great undertaking of
collecting all the pamphlets published in England,
and he continued it until May 1661. Many of
these were printed surreptitiously, and were obtained
with the greatest difficulty; in fact, seventy-three
of these were in manuscript, “which no man
durst then venture to publish without endangering
his ruine.” The King and the Cavalier party knew
of the existence of the collection, but every endeavour
was made to keep the knowledge from the
other party. If it were difficult to form the collection,
it was still more difficult to preserve it. We
are told that, “to prevent the discovery of them,
when the army was Northwards, he packed them in
several trunks, and, by one or two in a week, sent
them to a trusty friend in Surrey, who safely preserved
them, and when the army was Westward,
and fearing their return that way, they were sent
to London again; but the collector durst not keep
them, but sent them into Essex, and so according
as they lay near danger, still by timely removing
them at a great charge, secured them, but continued
perfecting the work.” Afterwards, for greater
security, they were lodged in the Bodleian Library,
and a pretended bargain was made, and a receipt
for £1000 given to the University of Oxford, so that
“if the Usurper had found them out the University
should claim them, who had greater power to
struggle for them than a private man.”</p>

<p>On one occasion Charles I. wished to consult
a particular pamphlet, and applied to Thomason
for the loan of it. In small quarto vol. 100 is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
manuscript note describing the particulars of this
interesting <span class="lock">loan:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Memorandum that Col. Will Legg and Mr. Arthur
Treavors were employed by his Mātie K. Charles to gett
for his present use, a pamphlet which his Mātie had then
occasion to make use of, and not meeting with it, they
both came to me, having heard that I did employ my selfe
to take up all such things, from the beginning of that Parlement,
and finding it with me, tould me it was for the
King’s owne use, I tould them all I had were at his Māties
command and service, and withall tould them if I should
part with it and loose it, presuming that when his Mātie
had done with it, that little account would be made of it,
and so I should loose by that losse a limbe of my collection,
which I should be very loth to do, well knowing it
would be impossible to supplie it if it should happen to be
lost, with which answer they returned to his Mātie at Hampton
Court (as I take it) and tould him they had found that
peece he so much desired and withall how loath he that
had it, was to part with, he much fearing its losse; whereupon
they were both sent to me againe by his Mātie to tell
me that upon the worde of a Kinge (to use their own expressions)
he would safely returne it, thereuppon immediately
by them I sent it to his Mātie, who having done
with it, and having it with him when he was going towards
the Isle of Wight, let it fall in the durt, and then callinge
for the two persons before mentioned (who attended him)
delivered it to them, with a charge, as they would answer it
another day, that they should both speedily and safely return
it to him, from whom they had received it, and withall to
desire the partie to goe on and continue what had begun,
which book together with his Māties signification to me by
these worthy and faithfull gentlemen I received both speedily
and safely. Which volume hath the marke of honor upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
it, which no other volume in my collection hath, and very
diligently and carefully I continued the same, until the most
hapie restoration and coronation of his most gratious mātie
Kinge Charles the second whom God long preserve.&mdash;<span class="smcap">George
Thomason</span>.”</p></div>

<p>Here we have surely an interesting instance of the
poetry of bibliography.</p>

<p>According to Mr. Madan’s calculation, there are
22,834 pamphlets in about 1983 volumes, and apparently
some hundred or so pieces have been lost from
the original set. The collection of these pamphlets
was made at very considerable expense, and Thomason
is said to have refused £4000 for them, “supposing
that sum not sufficient to reimburse him.” On his
death in 1666 a special trust was appointed under his
will to take charge of the collection, and Dr. Thomas
Barlow (Bodley’s librarian, 1652 to 1660) was one
of the trustees. In 1675 Barlow was appointed
Bishop of Lincoln, and in the following year requested
the Rev. George Thomason (son of the
bookseller) to take over the charge. After many
vicissitudes the books were bought for the absurdly
small sum of £300 for George III., who presented
the collection to the British Museum. It is impossible
to guess at the present price of what is
practically invaluable.</p>

<p>The famous antiquary Elias Ashmole, whose treasures
are now preserved at Oxford in the Ashmolean
Museum, records in his Diary some of his purchases,
as, on May 1667, “I bought Mr. John Booker’s study
of books, and gave £140 for them”; and again, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
June 12, 1681, “I bought Mr. Lilly’s library of books
of his widow for £50.”<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> We can judge of the character
of his library by these purchases of the collections
of two of his famous astrological friends.</p>

<p>Even in the seventeenth century men began to
be frightened at the increase of books, and Sir
Thomas Browne in his <i>Religio Medici</i> suggested
a system of destruction: “’Tis not a melancholy
<i>utinam</i> of my own, but the desires of better heads,
that there were a general synod&mdash;not to unite the
incompatible difference of religion, but&mdash;for the
benefit of learning, to reduce it, as it lay at first, in
a few and solid authors; and to condemn to the
fire those swarms and millions of rhapsodies, begotten
only to distract and abuse the weaker judgments
of scholars, and to maintain the trade and
mystery of typographers.” If there was reason for
this complaint two centuries ago, how much more
must there be now! but the project is unworkable,
and Time takes the matter in his own hand and
destroys. Fortunately the destruction chiefly takes
place among books not likely to be missed.</p>

<p>Three of the greatest book collectors of the
eighteenth century were Bishop Moore, the Earl
of Sunderland, and the Earl of Oxford. Bishop
Moore’s fine library, which consisted of about
thirty thousand volumes, was offered in 1714 to
Harley, Earl of Oxford, for £8000, but the latter
did not accept the offer because the bishop insisted
that the earl should pay the money at once,
although he was not to receive the books till the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
collector’s death. He would not really have had
long to wait, for the bishop died on July 31st of the
same year. The library, mainly through the influence
of Lord Townshend, was purchased for £6000
by George I., who presented it to the University
of Cambridge. This presentation gave rise to two
well-known epigrams, which have been frequently
misquoted. Dr. Trapp, the first Professor of Poetry
at Oxford, expressed the disgust of his University
in these <span class="lock">lines&mdash;</span></p>

<p>When Lord Treasurer Harley recommended
Queen Anne to purchase Sir Symonds d’Ewes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>’
manuscripts as the richest collection in England
after Sir Robert Cotton’s, and to present them to
a public library, the Queen answered, “It was no
virtue for her, a woman, to prefer, as she did, arts to
arms; but while the blood and honour of a nation
were at stake in her wars, she could not, till she had
secured her <i>living</i> subjects an honourable peace,
bestow their money upon <i>dead</i> letters.” Thereupon
the Lord Treasurer bought the collection himself
for £6000.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> The whole collection of the Harleian
MSS. (one of the greatest treasures of the British
Museum Library), which consists of 7639 volumes,
exclusive of 14,236 original rolls, charters, deeds,
and other legal instruments, was purchased by
Government for £10,000, or only £4000 more than
the Earl of Oxford gave for Sir Symonds d’Ewes’
manuscripts alone.</p>

<p>The Earl of Sunderland’s fine library was for
several years housed in the mansion which formerly
stood on the site of the Albany in Piccadilly. It
was removed to Blenheim in 1749, where it remained
till the great sale of 1881-83. Oldys
reports that the King of Denmark offered Lord
Sunderland’s heirs £30,000 for the library,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> and
that the great Duchess Sarah of Marlborough
was in favour of the offer being accepted, but it
was not.</p>

<p>We learn from Hearne’s “Remains” that £3000
was offered by the University of Oxford for the
noble library of Isaac Vossius, the free-thinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Canon of Windsor, and refused. Hearne adds,
“We should have purchased them, and not stood
in such a case upon punctilio and niceties,
when we are so lavish of our money upon trifles
that bring dishonour on the University.” The
library was taken abroad, and soon afterwards
sold to the University of Leyden for the same
amount as that previously offered by Oxford
(£3000).<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<p>Thomas Osborne, the chief bookseller of his
time, bought the great Harley library, consisting
of about 50,000 volumes of printed books, 41,000
prints, and about 350,000 pamphlets, for £13,000.
This seems a small amount for so matchless a
collection, but it is not certain that Osborne made
a very profitable investment by his purchase. We
shall have more to say of the bookseller and the
library in the next chapter.</p>

<p>As an instance of the low price of books at this
time, the anecdote of Mr. David Papillon’s agreement
with Osborne may be mentioned here. The
contract was that the bookseller should supply
Mr. Papillon (who died in 1762) with one hundred
pounds’ worth of books at threepence apiece, the
only conditions being that they should be perfect,
and that there should be no duplicates. Osborne
was at first pleased with his bargain, and sent in a
large number of books; but he soon found that it
would be impossible to carry out the agreement
without great loss, as he was obliged to send in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
books worth shillings instead of pence. Long
before he had supplied the eight thousand volumes
required, he begged to be let off the contract.</p>

<p>Things were worse in Russia, where Klostermann,
the bookseller to the Imperial Court, sold books by
the yard (fifty to one hundred roubles, according to
binding). Every courtier who had hopes of a visit
from the Empress Catharine was expected to have
a library, and as few of them had any literary taste,
they bought them at this rate. Sometimes waste-paper
books were lettered with the names of celebrated
authors.</p>

<p>Authorship could hardly become a profession
until after the invention of printing, and even then
it was long before a living could be got out of
books. Dr. Edward Castell laboured for seventeen
years in the compilation of his immense undertaking&mdash;the
<i>Lexicon Heptaglotton</i>, to accompany
Walton’s Polyglot Bible. During this time he maintained
at his own cost as writers seven Englishmen
and as many foreigners. All of them died
before the work was completed. Besides expending
£12,000 of his own money he was obliged to
borrow £2000 more, and this not being sufficient,
he petitioned Charles II. that a prison might not
be the reward of so much labour. Notwithstanding
a circular letter from the king recommending
the purchase of this work the author ended his
days in poverty, and a great part of the impression
was thrown into garrets, where many of the copies
were destroyed by damp or rats.</p>

<p>A similar case was that of Thomas Madox, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
learned author of the “History of the Exchequer,”
who wrote to Dr. Charlett requesting him to get his
book into the College Libraries at Oxford, and explaining
that the cost of the impression was £400
for paper and print, and as only 481 copies were
printed, “when all the books shall be sold I shall
be just able to pay the charges with a trifling over-plus.... This
affair,” he adds, “has given me
much perplexity, and perfectly cured me of scribbling.”<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<p>Thomas Hearne was more fortunate, and amassed
a small fortune by his publications. One thousand
guineas were found in gold in his rooms at St.
Edmund Hall after his death. His books were
soon out of print, and fetched large prices even in
his own lifetime.</p>

<p>Lord Spencer bought the whole of the library
of Count Revickzky, a catalogue of which had
been privately printed by the original owner at
Berlin in 1784. According to Dibdin, when the
Count was in England he offered his whole
collection to Lord Spencer for a certain round
sum to be paid to him immediately, and for a
yearly sum by way of annuity. The offer was
accepted, and as the Count died soon afterwards,
Lord Spencer obtained the library at a cheap rate.
The same noble collector offered the Duke di
Cassano Serra £500 for two books, viz., the <i>Juvenal</i>
of Ulric Han, and the <i>Horace</i> of Arnaldus de
Bruxella, Naples, 1474, but the offer was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
accepted. In 1820 Lord Spencer bought the whole
collection.</p>

<p>The Duke of Devonshire purchased the valuable
library of Dr. Thomas Dampier, Bishop of Ely,
for nearly £10,000 after the bishop’s death in
1812. Dr. Dibdin has printed in his “Reminiscences”
(vol. i. p. 363) a list of prices at which Dr.
Dampier valued the various classes of books in his
library.</p>

<p>Little idea of the prices of books can be obtained
from the amounts given for a whole library, but as
in future chapters particulars will be printed of
the great libraries that have been disposed of by
auction, it seemed well to mention here a few
instances of libraries that have been sold entire.
The greatest of these is the magnificent library of
Earl Spencer, which was sold in 1892 to Mrs.
Rylands, and has been transferred from Althorpe
to Manchester. The exact amount paid for this
library has not been announced, but it is supposed
to have been about a quarter of a million pounds.</p>

<p>In respect to the history of prices of books, there
have been times of inflation and times of depression,
just as in the history of prices generally, but it will
be seen that in spite of these vicissitudes scarce
books have gradually increased in value. The first
signs of the growth of <i>bibliomania</i> are seen in the
sales of Dr. Mead’s and Dr. Askew’s libraries in the
middle of the last century, which aroused a great
interest among book collectors.</p>

<p>During the great Napoleonic wars books became
very scarce, because Englishmen were prevented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
from purchasing on the Continent, but upon the
conclusion of the peace there was a steady flow of
books into the country.</p>

<p>The Duke of Roxburghe’s sale in 1812 was a great
event, forming, as it did, an epoch in the history of
book collecting, and the widespread fervour of bibliomaniacs
may be dated from that period. Great
sales followed, and then came the sale of the
enormous Heber library, which let out too many
books on the market at once. After this there
followed a dull time, but a revival came with the
Bright sale in 1846 and Stowe sale in 1849, and
the Daniel and Corser sales between 1860 and 1870,
and the Henry Perkins sale in 1873, were great
events. The last few years have been marked by
many great sales, those of the Sunderland, the
Beckford, and Hamilton Libraries, and the Turner,
Gaisford, Crawford, and Ashburnham collections
being among the most remarkable. The greatly
increased prices obtained for books have induced
many proprietors to sell their literary treasures.</p>

<p>It is well to remember that the value of all books
is not rising, but that whole classes have fallen in
price. Greek and Roman Classics, and the Fathers
and Theological Literature generally, have been
most markedly depreciated in value.</p>

<p>Fashion guides alterations in the prices of books,
just as she does in other less important matters.
Thus we find at one time certain books quoted at
high prices, which not many years afterwards have
become drugs in the market. Still, a careful review
of the subject will show that fashion is not nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
so potent as in some other departments, say, for
instance, in the case of pictures, which certainly
vary in price more than books. In spite, therefore,
of signs of variableness, it will be seen that there
is a continuous increase of price among certain
classes of books which are sure to retain their
value, and even to be still more esteemed as time
passes.</p>

<p>It may be well to inquire what are some of the
causes which lead to an increase in the price, and
to distinguish between those which are permanent
and those which are ephemeral. The growth of
book-collecting in the United States has had a most
potent influence, and large purchases made for
many years in England have drained off a large
number of books, low priced as well as high priced,
which will never return to this country. Another
cause is the increase of public libraries in Great
Britain, and when books are bought for these
libraries they are permanently removed from the
open market, as they are not when sold to an individual,
because his library will most probably
eventually come to the hammer. These two causes
would be sufficient in themselves to permanently
increase the price of scarce books, but there are
still others to be mentioned. There has been of
late years a greatly increased interest felt in the
history of books&mdash;in printing, in binding&mdash;and increased
knowledge has shown the great claims of
a large number of books to a higher appreciation
than hitherto. Then again, the class of the wealthy
who can afford to collect choice libraries has largely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
increased; and lastly, the belief that the collecting
of books is by no means a bad investment has not
been without effect. This last point opens up a
very interesting question in ethics, Should a collector
look upon his collections as an investment?
The late Mr. J. Hill Burton argues very strongly
against this view in his “Book-Hunter.” He
<span class="lock">writes&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The mercenary spirit must not be admitted to a share
in the enjoyments of the book-hunter.... If [he] allows
money-making, even for those he is to leave behind, to be
combined with his pursuit, it loses its fresh relish, its
exhilarating influence, and becomes the source of wretched
cares and paltry anxieties. When money is the object,
let a man speculate or become a miser.”...</p></div>

<p>This is quite true, but we must remember that,
after all, increased price is only an outward manifestation
of increased public estimation, and it is
always satisfactory to know that our opinion has
been accepted by the public. The real point seems
to be that the collector should use his judgment
in respect to price, and not trouble himself whether
the market value of individual books goes up or
down, for he may be sure that if he buys wisely,
the ups and the downs will balance each other.
If a fair-sized library is purchased with judgment
and knowledge, it cannot fail to become a profitable
investment, because good books increase in
value by reason of their companionship. All worthless
books should therefore be ruthlessly weeded
out. For instance, a library of 1000 choice books<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
would probably sell for less with 500 books of little
value added to them than if these were ruthlessly
eliminated.</p>

<p>Mr. Andrew Lang writes in his pretty little book,
“The <span class="lock">Library”&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“When Osborne sold the Harley collection, the scarcest
old English books fetched but three or four shillings. If
the Wandering Jew had been a collector in the last century,
he might have turned a pretty profit by selling his old
English books in this age.”</p></div>

<p>But Mr. Lang did not think of a calculation, by
which Mr. A. W. Pollard, in an interesting article
on “English Booksales, 1676-86” (<i>Bibliographica</i>,
vol. ii. p. 126), overthrew this view of the possibility
of great gains. He <span class="lock">writes&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is perhaps in accordance with precedent to remark
that, by the judicious expenditure of five-and-twenty
pounds during the ten years we have reviewed, a library
of about two hundred volumes might have been acquired,
which would now be cheap at £10,000. But
as the £25, if invested at compound interest at five
per cent., would now have amounted to nearly a million,
it is well for bookmen not to make too much of such
mercenary considerations.”</p></div>

<p>This question of price was formerly a delicate
one. Thus William Beloe was censured by some
collectors for drawing attention to the subject in
his “Anecdotes of Literature”; but that this objection
is got over now may be seen from the great
success of such a valuable annual as the “Book-Prices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Current,” notwithstanding the complaints of
some second-hand booksellers of injury to their
business from its revelation of the real value of
their books!</p>

<p>Dibdin mentions a book-collector to whom he
was pointed out at the Roxburghe sale, who exclaimed,
“Hang him! why did he not publish
his book in 1810? My books would have brought
double the prices.”<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>

<p>Dibdin doubtless influenced the market; and in
later times two men have exerted a very special
influence in raising the prices of books: these are
the late Mr. Henry Stevens and Mr. Bernard
Quaritch. The former drew his countrymen’s
attention to early books printed in and relating to
America, and he caused a considerable increase in
the price of Americana. But neither of these great
book-buyers could have permanently raised the
price of books if they had not devoted their attention
to books which were well worth these advanced
prices. When we deal with books of great beauty
and value, and of rare occurrence, which are wanted
by several rich book-collectors, it is difficult to say
what price is too great for such treasures.</p>

<p>It becomes, therefore, an important matter for the
book-collector to consider what are the rules that
guide the enhancement of price in books. It is
not easy to codify these rules, for varying circumstances
alter cases: thus new editions reduce the
value of some high-priced books, but have no effect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
in the case of others; and time supersedes some
books, while it enhances the value of others. There
are, however, one or two points which may be mentioned
as regulating price, for those persons who
suppose prices to be altogether erratic are certainly
wrong.</p>

<p>What, then, are the chief characteristics of a
book which make it valuable? “Uniquity,” to
use Horace Walpole’s word, is one of these; but
this is not always sufficient to keep up the price.</p>

<p>Good condition is the grand enhancer of value,
and dirty copies of even scarce works are seldom
worth much. But nowadays much is done by the
artist to improve these books. The leaves can be
washed, torn pages can be mended, imperfections
can be filled up by fac-similes, and then the whole
can be handsomely bound in morocco, so that the
owner scarcely knows his book again. Still, however,
one difficulty remains in the artistic make-up&mdash;a
short copy cannot be made into a tall one.</p>

<p>It is useless for the artist to spend his labour
upon other than the best books, such as the productions
of the early presses, original editions of
masterpieces, and works of permanent value in
their best possible form, with the authors’ final
corrections. The only high-priced books which
can dispense with interesting contents are specimens
of fine bindings; while here again, if the
historical binding covers a really valuable book,
the two elements of value united will cause a
remarkable enhancement of price.</p>

<p>Little need be said as to those books which fetch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
high prices for a time, and then when fashion alters
sink to a much lower level, as it will usually be
found that there was no intrinsic value attached to
these books, and therefore they were not such as
would be bought by the wise collector at a high
price. The fictitious value has usually been attained
by a system of limited editions and of judicious
advertising. Success in these cases is attained
among a class outside the experts in bibliography,
and therefore there is no cause for wonder that
mistakes are made. Sometimes the depression is
caused by the unexpected appearance of several
copies of a book, of which one or two copies only
were believed to exist.</p>

<p>In considering the probability of high prices
being sustained, it must always be borne in mind
that the peaceful and prosperous condition of the
country is taken for granted. In times of national
calamity little money is available for luxuries. Two
other important points must be remembered. (1)
That it is of no use for a book to be scarce if
nobody wants it. The money value of the phenomenally
dull book mentioned by Sir Walter Scott
is not recorded.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We have heard of one work of fiction so unutterably
stupid that the proprietor, diverted by the rarity of the
incident, offered the book, which consisted of two volumes
duodecimo, handsomely bound, to any person who would
declare upon his honour that he had read the whole from
beginning to end. But although this offer was made to the
passengers on board an Indiaman during a tedious outward-bound
voyage, the “Memoirs of Clegg the Clergyman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>”
(such was the title of this unhappy composition) completely
baffled the most dull and determined student on
board, when the love of glory prevailed with the boatswain,
a man of strong and solid parts, to hazard the attempt, and
he actually conquered and carried off the prize.”</p></div>

<p>(2) That good books are still very cheap, particularly
those which it is necessary to possess. So
much is talked about the high prices which books
fetch, that many are led to believe that he must be a
rich man who commences to collect a library; but
this is not so, for many good books in good condition
can be bought for a few shillings; in fact,
some of the best library books, well bound, do not
range at more than ten shillings per octavo volume,
and this cannot be called a high price. Ordinary
collectors must make up their minds to do without
Mazarin Bibles and first folios of Shakespeare, and
they will find that life can be lived without these
expensive luxuries.</p>

<p>In conclusion, it is necessary to strike a note of
warning respecting the bad paper which is used for
some books, and which render these books quite
worthless in a few years. Old books were made to
last; the materials used&mdash;paper and ink&mdash;were of
the very best, but many books of the present day
are made of bad materials, and contain within them
the elements of decay. Lately a German Commission
investigated this subject, and for their purpose
took out from the Berlin Library one hundred
volumes. They classified the paper upon which
these books were printed under the four headings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
of (1) good; (2) medium; (3) bad; (4) very bad.
About five books came under the first two classes,
and the remainder were about equally divided between
the third and fourth classes. Can we with
any confidence claim a better average for English
books? If not, the future of our modern books is
a dark one.</p>

<span class="smaller">SELLERS OF BOOKS</span></h2>


<p>It has been frequently remarked that a history of
bookselling would be a valuable addition to our
literature, but such a book would require extensive
research. In place of this a history of some booksellers
has been produced; but although the volumes
of Mr. Curwen and Mr. Roberts are interesting in
themselves, they do not go far to fill the vacant
space still open for a history of bookselling. Mr.
G. H. Putnam has gathered together much curious
information in his “Authors and their Public in
Ancient Times,” and “Books and their Makers
during the Middle Ages,” which, notwithstanding
some errors, form certainly a useful contribution
towards this history. The sellers of books have
greatly changed their habits with the altered conditions
of their trade. Among the Greeks there were
public shops for the sale of manuscripts, and in them
the learned met together to hear the manuscripts
read. In Rome the general mart for books was to
be found in the district devoted to the bibliopole,
and in his shop advertisements of new works were
stuck up.</p>

<p>At the break up of the Roman Empire the
producers of books were mostly found in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
monasteries, and booksellers were sellers of Paternosters,
Aves, &amp;c., as well as of books.</p>

<p>In the thirteenth century the <i>stationarii</i> not only
sold books, but accumulated much money by lending
them at high rates. Bookstalls were sometimes
placed in the church porch, and one of the doors of
Rouen Cathedral is still called <i>le portail des libraires</i>.</p>

<p>When manuscripts were superseded by printed
books the business of selling books naturally became
a more important concern, although the
London company established by printers and publishers
was called the Company of Stationers. At first
one man often undertook all the varieties of book
production and bookselling, but gradually the four
broad divisions of printers, publishers, second-hand
booksellers, and auctioneers came into existence.</p>

<p>We know but little of the early publishers, although
much attention is now being paid to the lives and
works of the old book producers, and we may hope
to have in course of time much material for a history
of them. The great houses founded in the
eighteenth and at the beginning of the present
century are still with us, and large additions have
been made of late years to the ever-increasing roll.
At all events, there is no sign of a failure of published
books; whether they are all worthy to be
published is another matter.</p>

<p>Great changes have been made in the publishing
business, and one of the chief of these is the
frequent sale of remainders of new books. It is
worth a remark in passing that good books which
have been sold off often become scarce and more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
valuable than those which have only been sold in
the ordinary way. James Lackington was one of the
first to make a great business out of the sale of remainders;
he was followed by Tegg, and these two
men did much to cheapen and popularise literature.</p>

<p>Charles Knight will ever be remembered with
honour as the great pioneer in the cheapening
of good literature. The excellence of his shilling
volumes was a marvel when they were first published,
and even now it would be difficult to find
their equal. Knight had a great belief in the
adequacy of the penny as a price for a number of
a book. He published large quantities of books
at a penny a number&mdash;as one of the first cheap
periodicals&mdash;the <i>Penny Magazine</i>, and the first of
cheap encyclopædias&mdash;the <i>Penny Cyclopædia</i>. How
much good has been done by the large issues of
such excellent books as Knight’s weekly and monthly
volumes, the Libraries of Useful and Entertaining
Knowledge, Constable’s Miscellany, Murray’s
Family Library, Home and Colonial Library, and
Bohn’s Libraries!&mdash;books all of which are worthy
of a place in the library, and not like too many of
the cheap books of the present day, books to be
read and then thrown aside.</p>

<p>In taking note of some of the old second-hand
booksellers, special mention must be made of
Joseph Kirton of St. Paul’s Churchyard, whose
sign was “The King’s Arms,” because he was
Samuel Pepys’s bookseller&mdash;“my poor Kirton,” as
the latter calls him when he was ruined by the
Fire of London. Pepys tells us that “Kirton was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
utterly undone by the loss of all his stock, so that
from being worth seven or eight thousand pounds,
he was made two or three thousand pounds worse
than nothing.” (See “Diary,” October 5, 1666.)
The poor bookseller did not live long after his
great loss, for he died in October 1667. Pepys
records an interesting instance of the rise in price
of one of the books burnt in the great fire. On
March 20, 1666-67 he writes: “It is strange how
Rycaut’s ‘Discourse of Turky,’ which before the
fire I was asked but 8s. for, there being all but
twenty-two or thereabouts burned, I did now offer
20s., and he demands 50s., and I think I shall give
it him, though it be only as a monument of the
fire.” On April 8, 1667, he gives us some fuller
particulars, which are of interest: “So I away to
the Temple, to my new bookseller’s; and there I
did agree for Rycaut’s late ‘History of the Turkish
Policy,’ which costs me 55s.; whereas it was sold
plain before the late fire for 8s., and bound and
coloured as this for 20s., for I have bought it finely
bound and truly coloured, all the figures, of which
there was but six books done so, whereof the King
and Duke of York, and Duke of Monmouth and
Lord Arlington had four. The fifth was sold, and
I have bought the sixth.” There is no copy of this
edition in the British Museum.</p>

<p>John Dunton, the erratic bookseller and projector
of the eighteenth century, has left us in his “Life
and Errors” a most curious account of the booksellers
of his time, who are all, oddly enough,
either handsome themselves or have beautiful wives.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Nearly all are also eminent Christians; in fact, we
are told that of three hundred booksellers trading
in country towns the author knew not of one knave
or blockhead amongst them all.</p>

<p>Thomas Osborne, the most celebrated bookseller
of his day, is interesting to us as having had the
honour of being knocked down by Dr. Samuel
Johnson. Whether or no he deserved such a summary
punishment we cannot now tell, but although
he appears to have been more of a business man
than a literary character, what he did is sufficient
to place him in an honourable position in the
history of English bibliography. He bought the
finest library of the time, and sold it piecemeal at
reasonable prices. He employed two of the most
capable men of his day&mdash;Johnson and Oldys&mdash;to
make a Catalogue, which does credit to all concerned
in its production, and he did not make
much money by the transaction. The amount
he gave for the Harley library in 1742 (£13,000)
was less by £5000 than the binding of a portion
of the library had cost, but had he given more
he would certainly have been a loser. Osborne
projected a Catalogue, in which it was proposed
“that the books shall be distributed into distinct
classes, and every class arranged with some regard
to the age of the writers; that every book shall
be accurately described; that the peculiarities of
the editions shall be remarked, and observations
from the authors of literary history occasionally
interspersed, that by this Catalogue posterity may
be informed of the excellence and value of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
great collection, and thus promote the knowledge
of scarce books and elegant editions.” Maittaire
drew up the scheme of arrangement, and wrote
the Latin dedication to Lord Carteret, who was
then Secretary of State. Dr. Johnson wrote the
“Proposals” for printing the <i>Bibliotheca Harleiana</i>,
which afterwards were prefixed to the first volume.
But in spite of having such eminent helpers,
Osborne had to give up his project of an annotated
Catalogue, and he informed the public in the
preface to the third volume of his <span class="lock">failure&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“My original design was, as I have already explained, to
publish a methodical and exact Catalogue of this library,
upon the plan which has been laid down, as I am informed,
by several men of the first rank among the learned. It
was intended by those who undertook the work, to make
a very exact disposition of all the subjects, and to give an
account of the remarkable differences of the editions, and
other peculiarities, which make any book eminently valuable;
and it was imagined that some improvements might,
by pursuing this scheme, be made in Literary History.
With this view was the Catalogue begun, when the price
[5s. per volume] was fixed upon it in public advertisements;
and it cannot be denied that such a Catalogue would have
been willingly purchased by those who understood its use.
But when a few sheets had been printed, it was discovered
that the scheme was impracticable without more hands
than could be procured, or more time than the necessity
of a speedy sale would allow. The Catalogue was therefore
continued without notes, at least in the greatest part;
and though it was still performed better than those which
are daily offered to the public, fell much below the original
intention.”</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>The public were not very grateful for what they
did receive, and resented Osborne’s charge of five
shillings a volume for the Catalogue, which seems
reasonable enough now, but was then denounced
as “an avaricious innovation.” In answer to the
clamour the bookseller announced that “those
who have paid five shillings shall be allowed at
any time within three months after the day of sale
either to return them in exchange for books, or to
send them back and receive their money.” Another
complaint was that the books were priced
too high. As this was a serious charge, Osborne
got Johnson to put his answer into sonorous language,
that would at least make the complainers
ashamed of themselves: “If, therefore, I have set
a high value upon books, if I have vainly imagined
literature to be more fashionable than it really is,
or idly hoped to revive a taste well-nigh extinguished,
I know not why I should be persecuted
with clamour and invective, since I shall only
suffer by my mistake, and be obliged to keep those
books which I was in hopes of selling.”</p>

<p>Dibdin proves that this charge of over-pricing
is quite unjust. He writes: “Whoever inspects
Osborne’s Catalogue of 1748 (four years after the
Harleian sale) will find in it many of the most valuable
of Lord Oxford’s books; and among them a
copy of the Aldine Plato of 1513 struck off upon
vellum, marked at £21 only&mdash;for this identical copy
Lord Oxford gave 100 guineas, as Dr. Mead informed
Dr. Askew; from the latter of whose collections
it was purchased by Dr. Hunter, and is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
now in the Hunter Museum. There will be found
in Osborne’s Catalogues of 1748 and 1753 some of
the scarcest books in English literature marked at
2 or 3 or 4s. for which three times the number of
<i>pounds</i> is now given.”<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> Dibdin has given a useful
analysis of the contents of the Harleian Library in
his <i>Bibliomania</i>. Osborne published a large number
of catalogues full of literary curiosities, and with
interesting notes and prefaces. In Mr. Thorpe’s
Catalogue of 1851 there is a notice of a set of
Osborne’s Catalogues from 1729 to 1768, in forty-three
volumes octavo. This famous bookseller died
on 27th August 1767, and he is said to have left
behind him some forty thousand pounds.</p>

<p>No bookseller has ever been held in higher
esteem than Thomas Payne, who was honourably
known as “honest Tom Payne.” Payne’s shop at
the Mews Gate, where the National Gallery now
stands, was for years the great afternoon resort of
the chief book collectors. Here met such men as
Cracherode, George Steevens, Malone, Lord Spencer,
Grenville, Bishop Dampier, Towneley, and Colonel
Stanley. Payne lived at the Mews Gate for forty
years, having commenced business as an assistant
to his elder brother, Oliver Payne. Thomas’s first
catalogue, when he set up for himself, is dated
1740. He removed to Pall Mall, and retired from
business in 1790. He died in 1799, at the age of
eighty-two. He was succeeded by his son, who, in
partnership with Henry Foss, carried on a first-rate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
bookselling business in Pall Mall for many years.
The catalogue of the Grenville Library was made
and published by them.</p>

<p>George Nicol, styled by Beloe in his <i>Sexagenarian</i>
“a superb bookseller,” was a man of great
influence in his day. He was largely instrumental
in the purchase of much of two magnificent libraries&mdash;those
of George III. and the Duke of Roxburghe&mdash;and
he was highly esteemed by both his employers.
He always spoke of the King as his beloved master.
It was he who induced R. H. Evans, the bookseller,
to adopt the business of an auctioneer by offering
him the sale of the Roxburghe library.</p>

<p>Another bookseller who occupies a prominent
position in the roll of learned and high-principled
members of the calling was Thomas Rodd, of Great
Newport Street. His catalogues were of great interest,
and he numbered among his customers most
of the book-collectors of his time. Lord Campbell
referred to him in one of his books as “that very
learned and worthy bookseller, my friend Thomas
Rodd.”</p>

<p>A rival of Rodd was Thomas Thorpe, who commenced
business in Covent Garden, removed to Piccadilly,
and in his later days returned to Covent
Garden. Thorpe was a masterful man, who carried
everything before him, and published a series of
valuable catalogues, from which may be obtained
a history of prices for many years. Dibdin, in his
“Reminiscences” (1806), says, “I know of no such
dogged, indomitable energy and perseverance as
that of this renowned bibliopolist”; and again, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
the preface to his “Library Companion,” he writes,
“Mr. Thorpe is indeed a man of might. His
achievements at book-sales are occasionally described
in the ensuing pages. It is his catalogues
I am here to treat. They are never-ceasing productions;
thronged with treasures which he has gallantly
borne off at the point of his lance, in many
a hard day’s fight in the Pall Mall and Waterloo
Place arenas. But these conquests are no sooner
obtained than the public receives an account of
them; and during the last year only, his catalogues
in three parts, now before me, comprise not fewer
than seventeen thousand nine hundred and fifty-nine
articles. What a scale of buying and selling
does this fact alone evince! But in this present
year two parts have already appeared, containing
upwards of twelve thousand articles. Nor is this
all. On the 24th day of September, in the year of
our Lord 1823, there appeared the most marvellous
phenomenon ever witnessed in the annals of bibliopolism.
The <i>Times</i> newspaper had four of the five
columns of its last page occupied by an advertisement
of Mr. Thorpe, containing the third part of his
catalogue for that year. On a moderate computation
this advertisement comprised eleven hundred
and twenty lines.” Greater things have been done
since.</p>

<p>The Bohns were mighty booksellers in their time&mdash;John
the father, and Henry and James the two
sons; but Henry Bohn made the greatest name.
His famous Guinea Catalogue (“the guinea pig”)
was long a marvel, at least in respect to thickness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
till Mr. Quaritch decided to far outrival it, and
make it appear slim by the side of his huge
volumes. Henry Bohn was a remarkable man,
and the cultivator of many tastes. In later life he
neglected second-hand bookselling for publishing
and the selling of remainders. He has already
been mentioned as one of the chief of those who
have supplied the public with sound cheap literature.
Bohn was fond of exhibiting his importance,
and when at a book-sale he would, catalogue in
hand, inspect the lots far ahead, and occasionally
look up and arrest the course of the sale by inquiring
of the auctioneer what was the number of
the lot then selling.</p>

<p>Mr. Quaritch has outdone all previous booksellers
by the grandeur of his catalogues. They
have grown in size and importance, until the last
General Catalogue, in seven volumes and nine
supplements, a large paper copy of which is in the
Reading-room of the British Museum, throws all
other catalogues into the shade. The volumes containing
the various classes into which the catalogue
is divided each form a most valuable bibliography
and a grand record of the present prices of books.</p>

<p>This is not a history of booksellers, and therefore
more need not be said of them here than that a
body of men to whom book collectors are greatly
indebted may well be proud of numbering in their
ranks those already named, as well as the Pickerings,
the Lillys, the Boones, the Ellises, and the Bains,
upon whose exploits we have not space to enlarge.</p>

<h3>AUCTIONEERS</h3>

<p>William Cooper, a bookseller in a good way of
business at the sign of the Pelican in Little Britain,
was the first to introduce into England the practice
of selling books by auction, when in 1676 he sold
Dr. Seaman’s library, and for some years he was
the chief auctioneer in London. His first catalogue&mdash;the
first sale catalogue in England&mdash;is exhibited
in the Kings’ Library at the British Museum.</p>

<p>In 1680 Edward Millington, a better known man
and a bookseller of standing, took to auctioneering,
and he and Cooper together divided the chief business
in this department. Other booksellers, such
as Moses Pitt, Zachary Bourne, Nathaniel Ranew,
Richard Chiswell, and John Dunsmore, Robert
Scott, &amp;c., sold books by auction, and Oldys styles
Marmaduke Foster, who made the catalogue of
Thomason’s Civil War Tracts in twelve folio manuscript
volumes, an auctioneer. It is, however, of
the two foremost men, Cooper and Millington, that
we want to know more, and fortunately a wit of
Christ Church, Oxford, George Smalridge, afterwards
Dean of Christ Church and Bishop of Bristol,
was struck by the humours connected with the sale
in 1686 of the stock of a bankrupt Oxford bookseller&mdash;Richard
Davis, the publisher of several of
the Hon. Robert Boyle’s works. Smalridge wrote
a skit on the proceedings, under the title of “Auctio
Davisiana Oxonii habita per Gulielmum Cooper,
Edoar. Millingtonum, Bibliop. Lond. ... Londini:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Prostant venales apud Jacobum Tonson, 1689.”
This was reprinted in <i>Musarum Anglicanarum
Analecta</i>, vol. i. 1691.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></p>

<p>The sale, according to Anthony à Wood, took
place “in a large stone fabric opposite St. Michael’s
Church, in Oxon., near the north gate of the city,
called Bocardo” (a prison in the Middle Ages),
and apparently it attracted a great deal of attention
on account of the novelty of the mode of
sale. Smalridge fastened on the salient points,
and he has thus given us information respecting
the conduct of a sale in the seventeenth
century which we should not otherwise have possessed.
The persons of the little drama are six
Christ Church men&mdash;Arthur Kaye, Walter Bacon,
Ed. Stradling, George Dixon, Christopher Codrington,
and William Woodward&mdash;and in the pride of
their learning they make sad fun of the pomposity
and ignorance of the poor auctioneers. We must,
however, remember that this is a satire and a caricature.
Cooper is described as “a man of wonderful
and notable gravity,” with a monstrous paunch;
and Millington as having a Stentor’s lungs and consummate
impudence, a very windbag, whose hollow
bellows blow lies.</p>

<p>Woodward took the part of Cooper, and Codrington
that of Millington, but when these characters
were first pressed upon them, the latter urged that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
“if a book is bad, I cannot pile encomiums on it,
and prefer Wither to Virgil, or Merlin to the Sibyls.”
We are told that bids of one penny were taken, and
that when the third blow of the hammer has been
struck the sale was irrevocable. The auctioneers
seem to have offended the ears of the Oxonians by
saying “Nepŏtis” and “Stephāni.” At the end of the
day Woodward is made to say, “I have spoken, I
the great Cooper, whose house is in Little Britain.”
Codrington recites a long rhodomontade ending
thus: “I check myself and put a curb on the
runaway muses. But this mallet, the badge of my
profession, I affix as a dedicatory offering to this
post&mdash;To Oxford and the Arts Millington consecrates
these arms.” Dunton draws a favourable
portrait of Millington in his “Life and Errors.”
He says he “commenced and continued auctions
upon the authority of Herodotus, who commends
that way of sale for the disposal of the most exquisite
and finest beauties to their <i>amorosos;</i> and
further informs the world that the sum so raised
was laid out for the portions of those to whom
nature had been less kind: so that he’ll never be
forgotten while his name is Ned, or he, a man of
remarkable elocution, wit, sense, and modesty&mdash;characters
so eminently his, that he would be
known by them among a thousand. Millington
(from the time he sold Dr. Annesly’s library) expressed
a particular friendship to me. He was
originally a bookseller, which he left off, being
better cut out for an auctioneer. He had a quick
wit, and a wonderful fluency of speech. There was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
usually as much comedy in his ‘once, twice, thrice,’
as can be met with in a modern play. ‘Where,’
said Millington, ‘is your generous flame for learning?
Who but a sot or a blockhead would have
money in his pocket and starve his brains?’
Though I suppose he had but a round of jests, Dr.
Cave once bidding too leisurely for a book, says
Millington, ‘Is this your “Primitive Christianity?”’
alluding to a book the honest doctor had published
under that title. He died in Cambridge, and
I hear they bestowed an elegy on his memory, and
design to raise a monument to his ashes.” Thomas
Hearne does not give him so good a character. He
writes under date 13th September 1723: “Though
the late Mr. Millington of London, bookseller, was
certainly the best auctioneer in the world, being
a man of great wit and fluency of speech, and a
thorough master of his trade; though, at the same
time, very impudent and saucy, yet he could not
at the end of the auction, be brought to give an
account to the persons who employed him, so that
by that means, he allowed what he pleased and no
more, and kept a great number of books that were
not sold to himself. Whence arose that vast stock
of books, though most of them but ordinary, that
he had when he dyed, and which, after his death,
were sold by auction.”<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></p>

<p>“An Elegy upon the Lamented Death of Mr. Edward
Millington, the famous Auctioneer,” alluded to
by Dunton, is printed in the “Works of Mr. Thomas
Brown,” ed. 1744, iv. p. 320, but the Rev. C. H.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Hartshorne quotes it in his “Book Rarities of Cambridge,”
1829, p. 450, from Bagford’s Collection,
British Museum, Harleian MSS., No. 5947. It reads
as <span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>We have given so much space to Millington,
because it is interesting to see how similar were
the practices of auctioneers at the first institution
of the business to what they are at the present time,
and also because Millington seems to have been
considered the most famous of auctioneers, until
James Christie arose to take his place as chief representative
of the profession. It may be added
to his honour that he was a friend of Milton, who
lodged in his house.</p>

<p>Richard Chiswell (1639-1711) was more of a
bookseller than an auctioneer, but his name must
be mentioned here. He was one of the four who
issued the fourth folio edition of Shakespeare’s
Plays, and he was the official publisher of the
Votes of the House. Dunton describes him as
“the metropolitan bookseller of England, if not of
all the world,” and says that he never printed a bad
book, or one on bad paper.</p>

<p>Jonathan Greenwood, bookseller and auctioneer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
is described by Dunton as a worthy but unfortunate
man, “so that the chief thing he has left to boast of
is a virtuous wife and several small children.” He
adds, “But he still deserves the love and esteem
of all good men, for the worst that can be said of
him is, ‘There goes a poor honest man,’ which is
much better than ‘There goes a rich knave.’”</p>

<p>How little is known of some of these early auctioneers
may be seen from the fact that John
Bullord, who sold books at the end of the seventeenth
century, is said by the careful John Nichols
to be a member of the well-known bookselling
family of Ballard. I cannot find any information
respecting Bullord, but it is very improbable that
this name was merely a misspelling of Ballard.</p>

<p>The name of Samuel Paterson (1728-1802) will
always be held in honour among English bibliographers,
for he was one of the first to improve the
art of cataloguing, and he gained great fame from his
labours in this department. He had one great fault,
however, for he was so insatiable a reader, that when
in cataloguing he came upon a book he had not seen
before, he must needs read the book then, and
thus his work was much delayed, and often his
catalogues could not be obtained until a few hours
before the sale. He was the son of a woollen
draper in St. Paul’s, Covent Garden, but lost his
father when he was only twelve years old; his
guardian neglected him, and having involved his
property in his own bankruptcy, sent him to
France. Here he acquired a considerable knowledge
of French literature, which served him in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
good stead through life. When little more than
twenty years of age he opened a shop in the Strand,
opposite Durham Yard. This bookselling business
was unsuccessful, and he then commenced as a
general auctioneer at Essex House. It was during
this period of his life that he saved the collection
of valuable manuscripts formerly belonging to Sir
Julius Cæsar from being sold as waste-paper to a
cheesemonger. He classified the MSS., and made
an excellent catalogue of them, and when they
came to be sold by auction they realised £356.
Although Paterson made an excellent auctioneer,
he was no more successful financially than in his
other ventures. He therefore accepted the post of
librarian to the Earl of Shelburne (afterwards first
Marquis of Lansdowne); but after a few years there
was a quarrel, and he was obliged to return to the
business of cataloguing and selling of libraries.</p>

<p>The Rev. C. H. Hartshorne, in his “Book
Rarities,” mentions a print by Nicholls in the
British Museum, called “The Complete Auctioneer,”
representing a man with spectacles on,
standing at a table covered with books, which are
lettered at the tops. Underneath are these <span class="lock">lines&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Although the London booksellers went into the
country to sell books, there were some local auctioneers,
as, for instance, Michael Johnson (the
father of Dr. Samuel Johnson), who kept a bookstall
in Lichfield, and attended the neighbouring
towns on market days. Johnson’s address to his
customers is taken from “A Catalogue of Choice
Books, ... to be sold by auction, or he who bids
most, at the Talbot, in Sidbury, Worcester,” and is
quoted from Clarke’s <i>Repertorium Bibliographicum</i>

<p>The sale took place in the evening, commencing
at six o’clock and continuing till all the lots were
sold.</p>

<p>The existing firms of literary auctioneers, Sotheby,
Wilkinson &amp; Hodge; Puttick &amp; Simpson; Christie,
Manson &amp; Woods; and Hodgsons, are all of considerable
standing, but Sotheby’s is of the greatest
antiquity. Samuel Baker, the founder of the
house, commenced business in 1744 with sale of
Dr. Thomas Pellet’s library (£859) in York Street,
Covent Garden. He continued sole member of the
firm till 1774, when he entered into partnership
with George Leigh (who is styled by Beloe “the
finical bookseller”). Baker died in 1778, in his
sixty-sixth year, when he left his property to his
nephew, John Sotheby, who in 1780 was in partnership
with Leigh. In 1800 the style was Leigh,
Sotheby &amp; Son, John Sotheby’s son Samuel being
taken into partnership. In 1803 the business was
removed from York Street to 145 Strand, opposite
Catharine Street, and in 1818 to the present house
in Wellington Street. The third and last Sotheby,
Mr. Samuel Leigh Sotheby, became a partner in
1837, and in 1843 Mr. John Wilkinson entered the
firm as a partner. The style was Sotheby and
Wilkinson till 1864, when Mr. Edward Grose
Hodge became a partner, and from that date the
name of the firm has been Sotheby, Wilkinson, and
Hodge.</p>

<p>The firm of Puttick &amp; Simpson dates back to the
establishment of the business by Mr. Stewart in
1794 at 191 Piccadilly. The business was bought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
by Wheatley &amp; Adlard on the retirement of Mr.
Stewart. For a short time it was carried on by Mr.
Fletcher, who was succeeded in 1846 by Messrs.
Puttick &amp; Simpson. In 1858 the business was
removed from Piccadilly to 47 Leicester Square.
Mr. Puttick died in 1873.</p>

<p>The firm of Christie’s was established soon after
that of Sotheby’s, and James Christie the elder’s
(1730-1803) first sale was on the 5th December
1766, at rooms in Pall Mall, formerly occupied by
the print warehouse of Richard Dalton. Christie
afterwards removed next door to Gainsborough, at
Schomberg House, and died there, 8th November
1803. His son, James Christie the younger (1773-1831),
was born in Pall Mall, and was educated
at Eton. In 1824 he removed to the present premises
in King Street, formerly Wilson’s European
Emporium. Mr. Christie died in King Street,
2nd February 1831, aged fifty-eight. Mr. George
Christie succeeded his father. Mr. William Manson
died in 1852, and was succeeded by his brother,
Mr. Edward Manson. In 1859 Mr. James Christie,
the great-grandson of the founder, and Mr. Thomas
Woods, joined the firm.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III<br />

<span class="smaller">PRICES OF MANUSCRIPT BOOKS</span></h2>


<p>In a treatise devoted to an inquiry concerning the
varying prices of books, it is necessary that at least
one chapter should be devoted to manuscripts.
There is no field of investigation which offers a
more interesting subject for study, and few that are
more difficult to master. Manuscripts are really
more attractive than printed books, because they
are so various, and have been produced over a
much longer period of the world’s history. It
is therefore strange that so few authors care to
trouble themselves about them; that this is so may
be seen from the large number of readers at the
British Museum who are contented to quote over
and over again from the much-used printed books,
and the comparatively few who cultivate the virgin
soil of the Manuscript Department, where there are
endless stores of unused materials.</p>

<p>Manuscripts are usually somewhat miscellaneous
in character, for they consist (1) of some of the
finest examples of the pictorial art of many ages;
(2) of the originals of the great works of antiquity;
(3) of a large number of valuable works that have
never been printed; (4) of charters, documents,
letters, memoranda, &amp;c., which are of great value,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
but which are not books, and therefore do not
come within the scope of our present inquiry. In
respect to the prices of the manuscripts, it is very
difficult to say anything of much value, because
(1) many of the most important manuscripts have
been transferred from library to library in bulk,
and it is comparatively seldom that they come up
for public sale; (2) the buyers of manuscripts are
fewer than those of printed books, and therefore it
is more difficult to arrive at a real standard price
for books which are practically unique, as there is
no wide public opinion upon the subject. But for
the present purpose, a still more important reason
why this vast subject cannot be dealt with in a
succinct manner is, that the materials for its history
have not yet been thoroughly investigated by experts.
The relative prices at different periods are
hard to understand, even in England, where money
has been better regulated than in most countries;
but when we have to deal with foreign countries
and foreign coins, we are necessarily at a loss how
to convert into their present value coins which may
have been depreciated at the time we are dealing
with, and have certainly been still more depreciated
since: for instance, what idea is communicated to
the mind of the modern reader when he is told that
“Borso d’Este paid forty ducats for a <i>Josephus</i> and
a <i>Quintus Curtius</i>, while his large two-volume Bible
cost him 1375 sequins”?<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<p>In dealing with manuscripts, it is most important
to distinguish between plain and illuminated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
manuscripts. The neglect of this caution has led to
an exaggerated idea of the cost of books before the
invention of printing. Instances have been given
of purchases at sums equal to a king’s ransom.
Hence it is supposed that books were so dear
that they were quite out of the reach of any but
the richest personages. But this view is erroneous,
for we know that by means of the slave
labour at Rome and the organised work in the
monasteries, plainly written manuscripts could be
obtained at a reasonable price. We know now that
transcripts of MSS. can be had at a price which,
if dear when compared with the price of a newly-published
printed book, is by no means extravagant.
What could be done at a centre of civilisation like
Rome, where books were produced in large numbers
and at low prices on account of the organisation
of literary production, could be done at other places.
There is evidence that at London, and at those seats
of learning, Oxford and Cambridge, where caligraphy
was a profession, books were not difficult to obtain.
Every church and chapel must have had service-books.
Probably during the Middle Ages, when
travelling was arduous and expensive, persons living
in out-of-the-way places had to pay special prices
for their literary treasures.</p>

<p>The late Professor J. Henry Middleton referred
to this matter of cost in his valuable work on “Illuminated
Manuscripts” (1892). After quoting from
Aulus Gellius, he <span class="lock">wrote&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“But ordinary copies of newly-published works, even
by popular authors, appear to have been but little more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
expensive than books of this class are at the present day.
The publisher and bookseller Tryphon could sell Martial’s
first book of <i>Epigrams</i> at a profit for two denarii&mdash;barely
two shillings in modern value (see Mart. xiii. 3). It may
seem strange that written manuscripts should not have been
much more costly than printed books, but when one considers
how they were produced, the reason is evident. Atticus,
the Sosii, and other chief publishers of Rome, owned a large
number of slaves, who were trained to be neat and rapid
scribes. Fifty or a hundred of these slaves could write from
the dictation of one reader, and thus a small edition of a
new volume of Horace’s <i>Odes</i> or Martial’s <i>Epigrams</i> could
be produced with great rapidity, and at very small cost”
(p. 19).</p></div>

<p>In the fifteenth century, even, illustrated Books
of Hours were produced in France, Flanders, and
Holland at a cheap rate. Mr. Middleton <span class="lock">wrote&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Education had gradually been extended among various
classes of laymen, and by the middle of the fifteenth century
it appears to have been usual not only for all men above the
rank of artizans to be able to read, but even women of the
wealthy bourgeois class could make use of prayer-books.
Hence arose a great demand for pictured <i>Books of Hours</i>,
which appear to have been produced in enormous quantities
by the trade scribes of towns, such as Bruges, Paris, and
many others. These common manuscript Hours are monotonous
in form and detail; they nearly always have the same
set of miniatures, which are coarse in detail and harsh in
colour” (p. 141).</p></div>

<p>Mr. Middleton gives some further information respecting
the cost of production of certain service-books
taken from some church records in the
fourteenth and fifteenth <span class="lock">centuries&mdash;</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“From these accounts (1379-1385) we learn that six
manuscripts were written, illuminated, and bound, one of
them with gold or silver clasps or bosses, at a total cost of
£14, 9s. 3d., more than £150 in modern value” (p. 222).
“Three Processionals only cost £1, 17s. 4d., being on forty-six
quaternions of cheap parchment made of sheepskin,
which cost only 2½d. the quaternion” (p. 223).</p></div>

<p>There was thus great variety of cost in the production
of the various kinds of books, but when we
consider the matter, we shall find it impossible to do
other than believe that a demand for service-books,
the price of which was not prohibitive, must have
existed.</p>

<p>The Rev. T. Hartwell Horne gave in his “Introduction
to Bibliography” some instances of the
prices of manuscripts in the Middle Ages, but as
some of these were evidently exceptional cases,
although they have been used by historians to draw
conclusions which we must consider as erroneous,
they need not be repeated here.</p>

<p>Dr. S. R. Maitland in his admirable work on the
“Dark Ages” comments with much acuteness on
some of these cases as quoted by Dr. Robertson,
and shows that the historian has drawn a general
conclusion from special instances, which in certain
cases have not been correctly reported. Maitland
adds that some writer a few centuries hence <span class="lock">might&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Tell his gaping readers ... that in the year 1812 one
of our nobility gave £2260 and another £1060 for a
single volume, and that the next year a Johnson’s Dictionary
was sold by public auction to a plebeian purchaser
for £200. A few such facts would quite set up some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
future Robertson, whose readers would never dream that
we could get better reading, and plenty of it, much cheaper
at that very time. The simple fact is, that there has always
been such a thing as bibliomania since there have been
books in the world, and no member of the Roxburghe Club
has yet equalled the Elector of Bavaria, who gave a town
for a single manuscript” (pp. 66-7).</p></div>

<p>Interesting particulars respecting the composition,
binding, and expenses of Petrarch’s library will be
found in M. de Nolhac’s monograph on the subject.
Petrarch kept copyists in his house, whose shortcomings
occasioned him much vexation. He bequeathed
his library to Venice, and the Venetians
are accused of having suffered it to be dispersed,
but it would seem that it never reached them.</p>

<p>We may judge from the immense number of
manuscripts still existing, in spite of the wholesale
destruction that occurred at various times, how
large was the output in the Middle Ages. It is
therefore preposterous to suppose that when books
were being produced in large numbers in hundreds
of monasteries in Europe they were only bought
by kings or great nobles.</p>

<p>During the troubled times of the Barons’ Wars
there must have been great destruction of literary
treasures, and at the Reformation, when whole
libraries were destroyed and made waste-paper of,
the ignorant waste was appalling. “The splendid and
magnificent abbey of Malmesbury, which possessed
some of the finest manuscripts in the kingdom, was
ransacked, and its treasures either sold, or burnt to
serve the commonest purposes of life. An antiquary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
who travelled through that town many years after
the dissolution, relates that he saw broken windows
patched up with remnants of the most valuable MSS.
on vellum, and that the bakers hadn’t even then
consumed the stores they had accumulated in heating
their ovens.”<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> That so much is left after the
wholesale raid on the monasteries is largely due
to the sound antiquarian taste of John Leland, to
whom we of later ages are supremely indebted.</p>

<p>In all times of political convulsions the learning
of the world stands a bad chance of escaping great
loss, and we are told that twenty-five thousand
manuscripts were burnt during the horrors of the
French Revolution.</p>

<p>Carelessness and the contempt felt for old books
are still the great destructive forces in the East,
and the Hon. Robert Curzon, who travelled in
search of manuscripts, gives in his “Visits to the
Monasteries in the Levant” (1849) a lively account
of the irreparable losses that are constantly occurring.
(See also Archdeacon Tattam’s and M. Pacho’s
narratives of their negotiations with the monks of
the Nitrian Desert for Syrian MSS., and the subsequent
experiences of Tischendorf and Mrs. Lewis.)
One of the most recent literary events is the recovery
of a number of Jewish manuscripts from a
<i>Genizah</i> or storehouse of old papers and parchments
at Cairo, where they were preserved indeed,
but entirely neglected.</p>

<p>The late Mr. Thorold Rogers paid considerable
attention to the prices of books, and recorded many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
valuable facts respecting them in his important
work, “History of Agriculture and Prices in England.”
After commenting on some prices in the
thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, he adds, “such
prices indicate that written literature was not wholly
inaccessible to the general public” (vol. i. p. 646).</p>

<p>The particulars of the cost of church books give
perhaps the best idea of prices, because these were
needed by a large number of the population. Some
of them were of small price, while others of a more
elaborate character were of great price. In the
year 1278 the bailiff of Farley spent six shillings and
eightpence for books for the church, and in 1300 the
monks of Ely paid six shillings for a <i>Decretal</i>, and
two shillings for <i>Speculum Gregorianum</i>. In 1329
the precentor received six shillings and sevenpence,
with an instruction to go to Balsham to purchase
books.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> In 1344 a Bible cost three pounds, and in
1357 a book was bought for Farley church for four
shillings.</p>

<p>Mr. Blades printed in his Life of Caxton an inventory
of the library of Jean, Duc de Berri, at the
château of Mohun sur Yevre, 1416. At the death
of the duke the library contained one hundred
and sixty-two volumes, valued at 14,909 livres.</p>

<p>In 1443 twenty-seven volumes were purchased
by the authorities of King’s Hall, Cambridge, from
the executors of John Paston (who had been their
steward), at a cost of £8, 17s. 4d. In 1447 the
same college bought a Psalter for three shillings
and eightpence, and a Donatus for one shilling.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>
<p>In 1449 twenty new Processionals cost All Souls
College one hundred and thirteen shillings and
fourpence, and in 1453 a book of Wycliffe’s was
bought for seven shillings and sixpence, and one
written against him for three shillings and sixpence.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a>
A manuscript of 157 leaves, containing some of
the works of St. Gregory, was bought in 1455 for
£3, 6s. 8d.</p>

<p>In 1459 Fastolfe’s books were highly priced; thus
a fair Mass book was fixed at ten pounds, and a
Holy Legend at the same sum, while two new great
Antiphons were together £13, 6s. 8d.</p>

<p>One of St. Augustine’s Epistles, containing 179
leaves, sold sometime after 1468 for £1, 13s. 4d.,
and about the same time one of St. Bernard’s
Treatises, written on 211 leaves, was bought by
Richard Hopton from the executors of a former
possessor for twenty shillings.</p>

<p>Perhaps a rather more accurate idea of the cost
of manuscript books can be obtained from a consideration
of the cost of materials and the pay of
the scribes, and, fortunately, particulars have come
down to us which allow of a comparison of the
various expenses.</p>

<p>A pocket lectionary was made in 1265 for the
use of Eleanor de Montfort, Countess of Leicester,
and sister of Henry III. Twenty dozen of fine
vellum were purchased for the work at the price
of ten shillings, and the writing, which was executed
at Oxford, cost fourteen shillings.</p>

<p>Richard du Marche, an illuminator, was paid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
forty shillings for illuminating a Psalter and a pair
of tablets for Queen Eleanor, consort of Edward I.</p>

<p>Professor Middleton printed in his “Illuminated
Manuscripts” (pp. 220-23) extracts from the Manuscript
Records of the Collegiate Church of St. George
at Windsor, from which it appears that John Prust
(Canon of Windsor from 1379 to 1385) was paid
£14, 9s. 3d. for six manuscripts written, illuminated,
and bound, one of them with gold or silver clasps
or bosses. The six books were an <i>Evangeliarium</i>,

<p>The “Grete Booke,” described above, is now
among the Lansdowne Manuscripts (No. 285) in
the British Museum, and is fully described in the
Catalogue of that Collection, 1812 (Part II., pp.
99-102).</p>

<p>In quoting the foregoing particulars of the early
sale of MSS. and of the cost of production, no
attempt has been made to calculate the present
value of the amounts set down, because the data
for such a calculation are not available. It will,
however, be well if the reader remembers that the
various amounts mentioned must have been equal
at the very least to ten times these sums in the
present day. Professor Middleton multiplies by
ten, but when we find an expert scribe charging
one penny and twopence for one leaf, and the
“commons” of another is set down at tenpence
per week, we may safely reckon the multiplier at
considerably more than ten in the fourteenth and
fifteenth centuries.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>
<p>The scribes and illuminators already mentioned
were the individual workers, who were employed
by corporations and men of wealth to produce
books for their libraries; but the wholesale producers
of books, who employed armies of scribes,
must not be overlooked in this place. Vespasiano
di Bisticci of Florence (<i>b.</i> 1421) was the chief of
these booksellers, and he assisted to form the three
most famous libraries in Italy&mdash;the Laurentian in
Florence, that of the Vatican, and the library of
Federigo, Duke of Urbino, which was afterwards
bought by Pope Alexander VII. and incorporated
into the Vatican Library. Vespasiano was an author
as well as a bookseller, and has recorded some of his
doings in his <i>Vite degli Uomini Illustri</i>. He gives a
detailed list of the works he obtained for the Duke
of Urbino, which comprised all the known classics,
the Fathers, books on astrology, science, medicine,
art, music, and all the Italian authors and poets.
Vespasiano claimed that in this magnificent library,
which cost 30,000 ducats, every author was found
complete, and not a page of his writings was missing.
Every book was written on vellum, and there
was not a single one of which he was ashamed.
Vespasiano was ever ready to form a library, as the
following anecdote will prove.</p>

<p>Niccolo Niccoli having spent a long life and all
his patrimony in collecting, left his books to Cosimo
to found a public library. Cosimo built the fine
pillared hall in the Convent of San Marco, and then
proposed to form a worthy public library, of which
the legacy of Niccoli should be the nucleus. He sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
for Vespasiano for his advice, who said, “You could
not <i>buy</i> books enough.” “Then what would you
do?” asked Cosimo. “Have them written,” replied
the bookseller. On which Cosimo gave the
commission, and Vespasiano set forty-five scribes
and illuminators to work, and furnished two hundred
volumes in twenty-two months. Cosimo was so
pleased with the books, that he employed the successful
purveyor to supply the illuminated Psalters
and Missals for the Church of the new Convent of
San Marco.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> No wonder, perhaps, that Vespasiano
expresses his great dislike for the new-fangled art
of printing. Every century has its own social convulsion,
and thinks it the most important of all
time. We talk of the revolutionary change made
by the introduction of machinery in the nineteenth
century, but we seldom realise how great a change
in the occupations of the people took place in the
fifteenth century, at the period of the invention of
printing. Large numbers of men entirely dependent
on their labours as scribes were thrown out
of work. Many of these men were members of influential
bodies, who were not inclined to sit down
idly under their misfortunes, so they petitioned
against the use of printing; but fate was too powerful
for them, and their endeavours to boycott the
printing-press were not successful, even though
Vespasiano di Bisticci said that Duke Federigo
would have been ashamed to have a printed book
in his library.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>
<p>John of Trittenheim, Abbot of Spanheim, who is
known in literature as Trithemius, said some hard
things against printing in an essay, <i>De Laude Scriptorum
Manualium</i>, <span class="lock">thus&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A work written on parchment could be preserved for a
thousand years, while it is probable that no volume printed
on paper will last for more than two centuries. Many important
works have not been printed, and the copies required
of these must be prepared by scribes. The scribe
who ceases to perform his work because of the invention of
printing can be no true lover of books, in that, regarding
only the present, he gives no due thought to the intellectual
cultivation of his successors. The printer has no care for
the beauty and the artistic form of books, while with the
scribe this is a labour of love.”</p></div>

<p>When, however, Trithemius found it necessary to
exhort his own monks, he was not able to speak
very favourably of their love of <span class="lock">books&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“There is, in my opinion, no manual labour more becoming
a monk than the writing of ecclesiastical books,
and preparing what is needful for others who write them,
for this holy labour will generally admit of being interrupted
by prayer and of watching for the food of the soul
no less than of the body. Need, also, urges us to labour
diligently in writing books, if we desire to have at hand
the means of usefully employing ourselves in spiritual
studies. For you see that all the library of this monastery,
which formerly was fine and large, has been so dissipated,
sold, and made away with by the disorderly monks before
us, that when I came I found but fourteen volumes.”<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>Others were wiser than to oppose the new art,
and many scribes, recognising the inevitable destruction
of their trade, became printers. Caxton’s
master, Colard Mansion, was an extensive writer
of manuscripts before he took to the business of
printing at Bruges. Much has been written upon
famous collections of manuscripts, and upon the
individual works which compose them, but it is
not often that these come to public auction, so that
the particulars of prices are comparatively meagre.
The grand collections of the British Museum and
the Bodleian<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> are preserved in safety for the use of
the learned, and we only know that they are of the
greatest value. What they would fetch if sold now
can only be guessed, and it would be merely frivolous
to inquire. Three of the grandest collections
in the Museum&mdash;the old Royal Library, the Cotton,
which was only saved from slow destruction by the
establishment of the British Museum, to which it
was transferred, and the Harley, which the nation
obtained for £10,000&mdash;must now be of untold value.</p>

<p>The purchase by the British Museum of the
library of Dr. Charles Burney greatly added to the
completeness of the collections of Greek Classics.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Among the manuscripts is the wonderful Iliad
of Homer on vellum, formerly belonging to Mr.
Towneley, which, although it cannot be dated
further back than the beginning of the fourteenth
century, is supposed to be of the earliest date of
the MSS. of the Iliad known to scholars. A committee
appointed to consider the purchase of the
library stated in their report: “With respect to
the value of the manuscripts, the Homer is rated
by the different witnesses at from £600 to £800,
and one of them supposed it might even reach so
high a price as £1000;<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> the Greek rhetoricians are
estimated at from £340 to £500; the larger copy
of the Greek Gospels at £200; the geography of
Ptolemy at £65; and the copy of Plautus at £50.
One witness estimates the whole of the ancient
manuscripts at upwards of £2500, and an eminent
bookseller at £3000.” “The books with manuscript
notes, together with Dr. Burney’s <i>Variorum
Compilation</i>, including the <i>Fragmenta Scenica Græca</i>,
are estimated by one at £1000, and by another as
high as £1340.” It must be remembered that this
was written in 1818, and these prices may be multiplied
considerably at the present day.</p>

<p>Even those large private collections which have
been in the market of late years have mostly been
sold in bulk, so that little light has been thrown
upon the current value of fine manuscripts.</p>

<p>One of the best sources of information respecting
present prices is to be found in Mr. Quaritch’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
admirable catalogues of his collections of literary
treasures.</p>

<p>When the treasures of Hamilton Palace were dispersed
by public auction, the priceless collection
of manuscripts was sold by private contract to
the German Government. The amount paid has
never been officially announced, but it is believed
to have reached the sum of £75,000. Some of
these manuscripts were not required at Berlin, and
they were sold in May 1889 by Messrs. Sotheby for
£15,189.</p>

<p>The gem of the collection was the fifteenth-century
manuscript of Dante’s <i>Divina Commedia</i>,
illustrated with upwards of eighty drawings, attributed
to Sandro Botticelli. Of it a writer in the
<i>Times</i> said, “This priceless volume may, without
exaggeration, be described as the most valuable
manuscript in existence, from its artistic interest,
for it stands alone as an example of a literary
work of the first order illustrated by an artist of
the highest rank.”</p>

<p>It is impossible here even to register some of the
many beautiful works that made the manuscripts
of the Duke of Hamilton so famous. Great dissatisfaction
was felt by the British public when it was
found that these treasures were to be transported
to Berlin. Before the final decision was made, Mr.
Ruskin, in a “General statement explaining the
nature and purposes of St. George’s Guild,” <span class="lock">wrote&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I hear that the library of Hamilton Palace is to be
sold some time this spring. That library contains a collection
of manuscripts which the late Duke permitted me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
to examine at leisure, now some thirty years ago. It
contains many manuscripts for which I have no hope of
contending successfully, even if I wished to do so, against
the British Museum or the libraries of Paris and Vienna.
But it contains also a very large number of manuscripts,
among which I could assuredly choose some for which the
partly exhausted general demand might be not extravagantly
outbid, and I think the English public ought to have
confidence enough in my knowledge of art and history to
trust me with a considerable sum for this purpose.”</p></div>

<p>Mr. Quaritch, who entered into Mr. Ruskin’s
plans, circulated this pamphlet, and asked for contributions
to be sent to him, which he would forward
to Mr. Ruskin. Had the Government of this
country been of the same mind with Mr. Ruskin,
these manuscripts would not have been lost to the
country.</p>

<p>The sale of the Hamilton manuscripts to a foreign
Government naturally caused those who were interested
in these matters to feel great anxiety lest
the Earl of Ashburnham’s manuscripts, which it
was known the owner wished to sell, should also be
sent abroad. This collection consisted of upwards of
three thousand manuscripts in about four thousand
volumes, and were made up of purchases from the
Duke of Buckingham (Stowe) and M. Libri; and
of an Appendix consisting of separate manuscripts
purchased from time to time by the late Lord
Ashburnham.</p>

<p>(1) The Stowe collection grew out of the library
of MSS. formed by Thomas Astle, the palæographer,
and Keeper of the Records in the Tower. Astle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
directed by his will that his collection should be
offered to the Marquis of Buckingham on certain
specified terms, one of which was the payment of the
sum of £500. This amount was not of course any
measure of their value, and the bequest was made in
gratitude to the Grenville family for favours which
Astle had received from them. A room was built
at Stowe by Mr. (afterwards Sir John) Soane to
receive the collection, in which were charters, registers,
wardrobe accounts, inventories, correspondence,
and many items of the greatest historical
value. O’Conor’s Irish MSS. and the State Papers
of Arthur Capel, Earl of Essex, Lord-Lieutenant of
Ireland in the reign of Charles II., afterwards found
a home at Stowe. In April 1849 the Marquis of
Chandos wrote to Sir Robert Peel, stating that he
had recently had offers from private parties for the
Stowe manuscripts, and offering them to the British
Museum. Sir Frederick Madden valued the collection
at £8300, but he was only authorised to
treat with Lord Chandos for the Irish manuscripts
separately, and to seek for further information
respecting other portions of the collection. In the
meantime, however, the whole number were sold
to Lord Ashburnham for £8000.</p>

<p>(2) Libri collection. In June 1846 the Trustees of
the British Museum applied for Treasury sanction
to the expenditure of £9000 in the purchase of the
Libri manuscripts, but this was refused. In September
following renewed application was made
for £6600 for the collection, less the Napoleon
papers valued at £1000. The Treasury allowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
£6000 with commission to agents, but the negotiation
failed, and Lord Ashburnham obtained the
MSS. for £8000.</p>

<p>(3) Barrois collection, chiefly consisting of French
romances and poems, was offered to the British
Museum in 1848 for £6000. It was examined by
the Keeper of the Manuscripts, who recommended
the purchase, but apparently no application was
made to the Treasury, and the collection was soon
afterwards sold to Lord Ashburnham for the same
amount.</p>

<p>(4) Appendix of MSS. collected separately by
Bertram, fourth Earl of Ashburnham, among which
were some splendid illuminated manuscripts.</p>

<p>With respect to some of these manuscripts a
difficulty had arisen, owing to M. Léopold Delisle’s
claim that a large number of the manuscripts in
the Libri collection had been stolen from libraries
in France by Libri while holding the office of
Inspector-General of Libraries. M. Delisle also
alleged that at least sixty of the Barrois manuscripts
were stolen from the Paris National Library. In
November 1879 Lord Ashburnham offered to treat
for the sale of his library of printed books and
manuscripts with the Museum alone, or jointly with
the French Government, naming £160,000 as the
price for the whole, and stated that he had received
an offer to that amount “from another quarter.”
The Trustees then asked whether Lord Ashburnham
would treat for the manuscripts alone, and his
answer in January 1880 was that he had ascertained
that the offer he had received of £160,000 for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
whole library from a private individual was intended
for private speculation, and that the collection was
worth a great deal more. This amount, which
comes to about £500 for each manuscript, seems
to be very large, but competent authorities have
agreed to the valuation. At any rate, the Treasury
was not prepared to buy the whole at such a price,
and the Principal Librarian treated for the Stowe
collection alone, the price of which Lord Ashburnham
fixed at £30000.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> In the end these were
purchased for the nation.</p>

<p>For many years the late Sir Thomas Phillipps
was an omnivorous collector of manuscripts, and
his collections were vast. They are gradually being
sold by auction. Several portions have passed
under the hammer of Messrs. Sotheby, and others
are still to follow.</p>

<p>A very fine collection of illuminated manuscripts
was gathered in a very short period by William
Morris. It is fortunate that a collection made by
one who knew so well what to buy is not to be
dispersed or taken out of the kingdom. As long as
it remains intact it will be a worthy monument of
an enthusiastic lover of art who, while teaching the
present age, was not forgetful of the history of the
earlier workers in the same spirit.</p>

<p>We cannot register prices of such priceless manuscripts
as the Gospels of St. Cuthbert, for two centuries
at Lindisfarne, and now among the Cottonian
MSS. in the British Museum, or the Book of Kells
at Trinity College, Dublin&mdash;both of the seventh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
century; but some few books of great interest which
have been sold by auction may be mentioned here.
The chief of these is the splendid manuscript of the
Bible in the British Museum, said to have been presented
by Alcuin to Charlemagne. The vicissitudes
of this book are very remarkable. It was confiscated
during the French Revolution, and eventually
came into the possession of M. Speyr Passavant of
Basle, who unavailingly offered it for a large sum to
the chief libraries of Europe. It was offered to the
Trustees of the British Museum, first for £12,000,
then for £8000, and lastly for £6500. The unfounded
claims of the proprietor, who appears to
have been very much of a charlatan, appear to have
damaged the repute of the MS., and it remained on
his hands. On 27th April 1836 the volume was put
up to auction at Evans’s rooms, and was described
in six pages of a catalogue in which it was the chief
lot. It was catalogued as the Emperor Charlemagne’s
Bible&mdash;a manuscript on vellum by Alcuin,
completed <span class="smaller">A.D.</span> 800, presented to Charlemagne <span class="smaller">A.D.</span>
801 at the ceremony of his coronation, and mentioned
in his will. The date is not undisputed, and
it is supposed by some to be of about forty years
later. The statement that this Bible is mentioned
in the Emperor’s will is absolutely denied. The
price registered in Evans’s sale catalogue is £1500,
and the purchaser is given as Scordet, but the book
was really bought in, and it is said that few of the
biddings for it were genuine. After this failure
fresh overtures were made to the British Museum,
and in the end it was bought for that library for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
£750, which must be considered a small price for
so splendid and interesting a book. There was
some correspondence on this Bible in the <i>Gentleman’s
Magazine</i>, in which Sir Frederick Madden
took part. These letters are reprinted in Gomme’s
<i>Gentleman’s Magazine Library</i> (“Literary Curiosities,”
1888, pp. 234-64). Another historical manuscript
of particular beauty which has been several times
sold by auction, and now safely reposes at the
British Museum, is the famous so-called Bedford
Missal (really Book of Hours), written and illuminated
for John, Duke of Bedford, Regent of France
under Henry VI., to whom he presented the book in
the year 1430. It passed into the hands of Henry II.
of France, and long subsequently into those of
Lady Worsley (widow of Sir Robert Worsley), from
whom it was purchased by the Earl of Oxford, who
bequeathed it to his daughter, the Duchess of Portland.
At the latter’s sale in 1786 it was bought by
James Edwards the bookseller for £213, 3s. At
Edwards’s sale in 1815 it was bought for £687, 15s.
by the Marquis of Blandford, who afterwards sold
it to Mr. Broadley. At Broadley’s sale in 1833 Sir
John Tobin bought it for £1100. Sir John’s son
sold it to the bookseller from whom the British
Museum purchased it in 1852.</p>

<p>Two instances of most interesting manuscripts
sold at very inadequate prices may here be recorded.
One of the most distinguished among the Ashburnham
manuscripts was one known as the Albani
Missal. It is a manuscript of offices, and was executed
apparently for Alemanno Salviati, gonfalonier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
of Florence and brother-in-law of Lorenzo de’
Medici, and given by him to one of his relatives
of the house of Baroncelli. This beautiful volume
contains five full-page miniatures, each the work of
a master. The first is by the hand of Amico Aspertini,
of Bologna, the pupil of Francia; the next is
attributed to Lorenzo di Credi; the third and fourth
of high excellence, though unassigned; and the fifth
by Perugino, signed “Petrus Perusinus pinxit.”
For this artistic treasure Mr. James Dennistoun
gave £20 in Rome in the year 1838. When he had
purchased it he found that opposition to its leaving
Italy would be made on the part of the Roman
authorities, so he had it unbound and divided, and
got it sent to England privately a few pages at a
time. He afterwards sold it to Lord Ashburnham
for £700. These facts were printed in the <i>Times</i> in
1883 by a cousin of Mr. Dennistoun.</p>

<p>Mr. Madan gives in his “Books in Manuscript,”
1893, a very interesting account of a bargain obtained
by the Bodleian Library, which account is here reproduced
in a somewhat condensed form. “Six
years ago [1887] a little octavo volume, in worn
brown binding, stood on the shelves of a small parish
library in Suffolk, but was turned out and offered
at the end of a sale at Sotheby’s, presumably as
being unreadable to country folk.” It was described
in the catalogue as “Latin Gospels of the
Fourteenth Century, with English Illuminations.”
For the sum of £6 it passed into the Bodleian
Library, and came to be catalogued as an ordinary
accession. It was noticed that the writing was of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
the eleventh century, and that the illuminations
were valuable specimens of old English work of the
same century, comprising figures of the four evangelists,
of the Byzantine type, which was common
in the west of Europe; the drapery, however,
colouring, and accessories were purely English.
The book itself was seen to be not the complete
Gospels, but such portions as were used in the
service of the Mass at different times of the year.
On a fly-leaf was found a Latin poem, describing
how the book had dropped in the water and was
brought up by a soldier, who plunged in after it.
Surprise was expressed that the book was uninjured,
save a slight contraction of two of the leaves,
and to this expression was added, “May the king
and pious queen be saved for ever, whose book was
but now saved from the waves!” Curiosity was felt
as to the identity of this king and queen, when the
difficulty was solved by a reference to Forbes-Leith’s
“Life of St. Margaret of Scotland,” where this passage
occurs: “She had a book of the Gospels beautifully
adorned with gold and precious stones, and ornamented
with the figures of the four evangelists
painted and gilt.... She had always felt a particular
attachment for this book, more so than for
any of the others which she usually read.” Then
follows a story almost identical with the one given
above, which proves that the identical book is now
preserved in the Bodleian Library.</p>

<p>It is not often that bargains such as these can be
obtained, but in spite of a great rise in price large
numbers of manuscripts are still purchaseable on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
reasonable terms. The late Mr. J. H. Middleton
was particularly urgent in pointing this out, and his
words may appropriately close this <span class="lock">chapter&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“On the whole, a fine manuscript may be regarded as
about the cheapest work of art of bygone days that can
now be purchased by an appreciative collector. Many of
the finest and most perfectly preserved manuscripts which
now come into the market are actually sold for smaller
sums than they would have cost when they were new, in
spite of the great additional value and interest which they
have gained from their antiquity and comparative rarity.
For example, a beautiful and perfectly preserved historical
Anglo-Norman Vulgate of the thirteenth century, with its
full number of eighty-two pictured initials, written on between
six and seven hundred leaves of finest uterine vellum,
can now commonly be purchased for from £30 to £40.
This hardly represents the original value of the vellum on
which the manuscript is written.</p>

<p>“Manuscripts of a simpler character, however beautifully
written, if they are merely decorated with blue and red
initials, commonly sell for considerably less than the original
cost of their vellum.</p>

<p>“A collector with some real knowledge and appreciation
of what is artistically fine can perhaps lay out his money to
greater advantage in the purchase of manuscripts than by
buying works of art of any other class, either mediæval or
modern.”<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></p></div>

<span class="smaller">PUBLISHED PRICES</span></h2>


<p>It was impossible for the scribe (however low his
pay might be reduced) to compete with the printing-press,
and we have good authority for saying that
printed books could be obtained in the fifteenth
century for one-fifth of what would have been the
cost of the same books in manuscript. Mr. Putnam,
in his interesting work on the history of bookselling,
quotes from Bishop John of Aleria, who, writing
to Pope Paul II. in 1467, said that it was possible
to purchase in Rome for 20 gulden in gold works
which a few years earlier would have cost not less
than 100 gulden. Other books selling for 4 gulden
would previously have cost 20. Mr. Putnam also
quotes Madden, to the effect that in 1470 a copy of
the forty-eight line Bible, printed on parchment,
could be bought in Paris for 2000 francs, while the
cost of the same text a few years earlier in manuscript
would have been 10,000 francs.</p>

<p>It is rather curious to find that the present custom
of fixing a published price is comparatively modern,
and that the system for which some of our present
retail booksellers yearn&mdash;that is, of buying from the
publishers in bulk and retailing at their own price&mdash;was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
formerly in common use. In the old catalogues
of English books no prices are affixed to the
various entries, and the custom of printing the prices
of books was not general until the end of the seventeenth
century. But after all the booksellers’ latitude
was not very great, for the law stepped in to
limit the price of books.</p>

<p>We might naturally have supposed that the invention
of printing would have made a complete
break in the mode of selling books, but this was not
so. Continuity was preserved, and the company
to which the London trade belongs is not called
after the printers, but after the older order of
stationers. In a “Note of the State of the Company
of Printers, Bookesellers, and Bookebynders
comprehended under the name of Stacioners,”
dated 1582, we are told that “in the tyme of King
Henry the Eighte, there were but fewe Printers,
and those of good credit and competent wealth, at
whiche tyme and before there was an other sort
of men that were writers, lymners of Bookes and
diverse thinges for the Church and other uses,
called Stacioners, which have, and partly to this
daye do use to buy their bookes in grosse of the
saide Printers, bynde them up, and sell them in
their shops, whereby they well mayntayned their
families.”<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></p>

<p>It seems probable that the English booksellers
before the introduction of printing experienced
little interference in their business from foreign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
scribes, and therefore the bringing in of printed
books from abroad was distasteful to them. What
they particularly objected to was the importation
of these books bound instead of in sheets.</p>

<p>By “an Act touching the Marchauntes of Italy”
(1 Ric. III. cap. 9) aliens were prohibited from
importing certain goods into this country, but this
Act was not to “extend to Importers of Books, or
to any writer, limner, binder, or printer.”</p>

<p>In Henry VIII.’s reign this importation was found
intolerable, and “an Act for Printers and Binders
of Bokes” was passed (25 Hen. VIII. cap. 15).
It is stated in the preamble when the provision in
the Act of Richard III. was made there were few
books and few printers in England, but that at this
time large numbers of printed books were brought
into the <span class="lock">country&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Whereas, a great number of the King’s subjects within
this realm having “given themselves diligently to learn and
exercise the said craft of Printing, that at this day there
be within this realm a great number cunning and expert
in the said science or craft of printing, as able to exercise
the said craft in all points as any stranger, in any other
realm or country, and furthermore where there be a great
number of the King’s subjects within this realm which
[live] by the craft and mystery of binding of books, ... well
expert in the same,” yet “all this notwithstanding, there
are divers persons that bring from [beyond] the sea great
plenty of printed books&mdash;not only in the Latin tongue, but
also in our maternal English tongue&mdash;some bound in boards,
some in leather, and some in parchment, and them sell by
retail, whereby many of the King’s subjects, being binders
of books, and having none other faculty wherewith to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
their living, be destitute of work, and like to be undone,
except some reformation herein be had.”</p></div>

<p>Then follow some provisions respecting the sale
of books at too high a <span class="lock">price&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“And after the same enhancing and increasing of the
said prices of the said books and binding shall be so found
by the said twelve men or otherwise by the examination of
the said lord chancellor, lord treasurer, and justices, or
two of them; that then the same lord chancellor, lord
treasurer, and justices, or two of them at the least from time
to time shall have a power and authority to reform and
redress such enhancing of the prices of printed books by
their discretions, and to limit prices as well of the books
as for the binding of them; and over that the offender or
offenders thereof being convict by the examination of the
same lord chancellor, lord treasurer, and justices, or two
of them or otherwise, shall lose and forfeit for every book
by them sold whereof the price shall be enhanced for the
book or binding thereof, three shillings four pence.”</p></div>

<p>By the first Copyright Act (8 Anne, cap. 21) any
person thinking the published price of a book unreasonable
was to complain to the Archbishop of
Canterbury or other great dignitaries.</p>

<p>It would have been enlightening if our lawmakers
had told us what was in their opinion a reasonable
price for a book, but they are silent on this point.</p>

<p>We have unfortunately no information as to the
price for which Caxton sold his various books,
but he bequeathed fifteen copies of his “Golden
Legend” to the churchwardens of St. Margaret,
Westminster, who succeeded in selling twelve of
them between the years 1496 and 1500. For the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
first three copies they obtained six shillings and
eightpence each, but then they had to reduce the
price to five shillings and eightpence, at which price
they sold the next seven copies. The last two
copies only brought five shillings and sixpence and
five shillings respectively, so that evidently there
was a falling market.</p>

<p>Mr. Blades makes the following remarks on this
<span class="lock">point&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The commercial results of Caxton’s trade as a printer
are unknown; but as the fees paid at his burial were far
above the average, and as he evidently held a respectable
position in his parish, we must conclude that his business
was profitable. The preservation of the <i>Cost Book</i> of the
Ripoli Press has already been noticed, and some extracts
of interest translated therefrom. We may presume that
Caxton also kept exact accounts of his trade receipts and
expenditure, and if such were extant, the many doubts
which now surround the operations of his printing-office
would be definitely solved. We should then know the
price at which he sold his books&mdash;how many pence he
asked for his small quarto ‘quayers’ of poetry, or his pocket
editions of the ‘Horæ’ and ‘Psalter’&mdash;how many shillings
were required to purchase the thick folio volumes, such
as ‘Canterbury Tales,’ ‘King Arthur,’ &amp;c. That the price
was not much dearer than that paid for good editions now
we may infer from the rate at which fifteen copies of the
‘Golden Legend’ sold between 1496 and 1500. These
realised an average price of 6s. 8d. each, or about
£2, 13s. 4d. of modern money, a sum by no means too
great for a large illustrated work. This, however, would
depend on the number of copies considered necessary for
an edition, which probably varied according to the nature
of the work.... Some foreign printers issued as many as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
275 or 300 copies of editions of the Classics, but it is not
probable that Caxton ventured upon so large an impression,
as the demand for his publications must have been much
more restricted.”<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></p>
</div>

<p>It will be noticed that Mr. Blades is wrong in
saying that the copies of the “Golden Legend”
were sold at an <i>average</i> price of 6s. 8d., and it would
probably be more correct to give the equivalent
amount in modern money as £4, rather than
£2, 13s. 4d., but this is perhaps more a matter of
opinion.</p>

<p>Several old priced lists of books have come down
to us, and the most interesting of these are the two
printed and edited by Mr. F. Madan in the first
series of the <i>Collectanea</i> of the Oxford Historical
Society, and further annotated by the late Mr.
Henry Bradshaw. The first of these is an inventory,
with prices of books received in 1483 for sale
by John Hunt, stationer of the University of Oxford,
from Magister Peter Actor and Johannes de Aquisgrano,
to whom he promises to restore the books
or pay the price affixed in the list; and the second
is the Day-Book of John Dorne, bookseller in
Oxford <span class="smaller">A.D.</span> 1520. Mr. Bradshaw’s valuable annotations
(“A Half-Century of Notes”) were printed in
fac-simile of his handwriting in 1886, and afterwards
included in his “Collected Papers” (1889).</p>

<p>Dorne’s list is of great value, as showing what
was the literature sold at a great university city at
the beginning of the sixteenth century, and with
the much-needed explanations of Messrs. Madan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
and Bradshaw, it forms an important addition to
our knowledge, but there is not much in it that can
be quoted here with advantage. Latin theology
forms the bulk of the more important books sold,
and next to that Latin classics. English books
are few; among the cheapest items, service-books
and ballads, Christmas carols, and almanacs are
common. A large proportion of the entries are
marked in pence from one penny upwards, but
some are in shillings, and the largest amount for
one sale of several books was forty-eight shillings.</p>

<p><i>Bibliographica</i> (vol. i. p. 252) contains “Two
References to the English Book-Trade <i>circa</i> 1525.”
The first, which is from the “Interlude of the Four
Elements,” suggests that a large amount of the
output of the English presses at the beginning of
the sixteenth century was made up of ephemeral
<span class="lock">publications&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Much information respecting the prices of books
is found in the churchwardens’ accounts of the
various parishes of the kingdom, and extracts from
some of these have been printed in the <i>Gentleman’s
Magazine</i> and other places. Mr. Thorold Rogers also
has given several instances in the various volumes
of his great work on “Agriculture and Prices.”</p>

<p>Archbishop Cranmer, in his “Articles to be inquired
of ... within the Diocese of Canterbury,”
<span class="smaller">A.D.</span> 1548, asks “whether in every case they have
provided one book of the whole Bible of the largest
volume in English, and the Paraphrases of Erasmus,
also in English, upon the Gospels, and set up
the same in some convenient place in the church.”
In 1548 we find that the churchwardens of St.
Margaret’s, Westminster, paid five shillings for the
half part of the Paraphrases of Erasmus, and in
1549 the churchwardens of Wigtoft, Lincolnshire,
paid seven shillings for the same book. Archbishop
Parker required Jewel’s “Defence of the Apology”
to be placed in parish churches, and in 1570 the
churchwardens of Leverton, Lincolnshire, paid four
shillings for “half Mr. Juylle’s booke, called the
‘Appologie of Ingland,’” and fourpence for the
carriage of the same.</p>

<p>From the churchwardens’ accounts of the parish
of Stratton, county Cornwall, we learn that in 1565<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
two shillings were “paid for newe songes for the
church,” and twopence “for a nother lyttell boke.”
In 1570 twelvepence was “paid to Nicholas Oliver
of sent tives for a song of te deum,” fourpence was
paid “for mendyng of John Judes bybell which he
lonyd to the churche when the other was to bynd,”
and six shillings “for a newe communion book and
a psalter in the same.” On the other side twelvepence
was received “for two peces of old bookes
sold.”<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></p>

<p>The churchwardens of Canterbury parish gave
forty-one shillings for a church Bible in 1586, four
shillings for a prayer-book in 1598, and three shillings
and fourpence for a book of statutes in 1599.</p>

<p>Sir John Evans communicated to the <i>Archæologia</i><a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">31</a>
some most interesting extracts from the Private
Account Book of Sir William More of Loseley, in
Surrey, in the time of Queen Mary and Queen
Elizabeth, which contains an inventory of a collection
of about one hundred and twenty volumes.
This inventory gives us a vivid idea of the contents
of a country gentleman’s library in the sixteenth
century. There are the best chronicles of the time,
as Fabyan, Harding, &amp;c., translations of the classics,
and some in their original languages, statutes, new
books of justices and other legal works, books of
physic, dictionaries, &amp;c., and each of the books is
marked with a price. The most expensive books:&mdash;<i>Cronica
Cronicarum</i>, xxs; Minister’s <i>Cosmografye</i>,
xvjs; un byble, xs; a calapyne, xs [Calepino’s
Vocabulary of the Latin Tongue]; Fabyan’s <i>Cronicle</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
vs; Statuts of Henry theight, xijs; all the Statuts
of Kyng Edward the VI., ijs; all the Statuts of

New Testaments, “one in ffrench,” xxd, two “in

<p>In the days before copyright acts authors and
publishers often tried to safeguard their property
by obtaining patents. These were sometimes for
a particular book, as, for instance, Richard Field,
printer, in February 1592 was granted the sole
licence to print “Orlando Furioso translated into
English verse by John Harrington.” More often,
however, patents were granted to printers allowing
them the sole privilege of printing certain classes
of books. A licence “to imprint all manner of
books concerning the common laws of this realm”
was granted to Richard Tottell; one for primers
and books of private prayers to William Seres; one
to print all manner of songs of musick to Thomas
Tallis and William Bird; one for dictionaries generally
to H. Binneman; and one for almanacks and
prognostications to James Roberts and Richard
Watkins.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> Gradually by purchase or inheritance
nearly all the monopolies came into the possession
of the Stationers’ Company. Certain printers, however,
made a practice of pirating some of the most
popular English privileged books. The Company
resisted, and memorialised Lord Burghley in October
1582, with a complaint of the opposition met with in
making their search in the printing-house of one
“who printed all kinds of books at his pleasure.”<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></p>

<p>The chief leader of these invaders of privilege
was John Wolf, a freeman of the Fishmongers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>’
Company. In 1583 the Stationers’ Company drew
up thirteen heads of the “insolent and contemptuous
behaviour of John Wolf, printer, and his confederates,”
which they presented to the Privy Council.
From this indictment it appears that when Wolf
was “frendly persuaded to live in order and not
print men’s privileged copies,” he answered that
“he would print all their bokes if he lacked work,”
and added that “it was lawfull for all men to print
all lawfull bookes, what commandement soever her
Majestie gave to y<span class="super">e</span> contrary.” Wolf was no respecter
of persons, and his motto was, “I will live.”
Being admonished that he “being but one so meane
a man should not presume to contrarie her Highnesse
Governmente,” “Tush,” said he, “Luther was
but one man, and reformed all the world for religion,
and I am that man that must and will reforme
the government in this trade!” The Queen appointed
a Commission to inquire into the matter, but the
Commissioners could make nothing of Wolf and
his party. In the end the opposition was bought
off; and on 1st July 1583 Wolf was admitted a freeman
of the Stationers’ Company by redemption,
paying the usual fees of 3s. 4d.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">35</a></p>

<p>Andrew Maunsell, a bookseller living in Lothbury,
was the first to publish (1595) a catalogue of
English books, and this book is a very satisfactory
bit of bibliographical work. The compiler only published
two parts, the first on theological books, and
the second on scientific books. Maunsell proposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
the publication of others on more popular branches
of literature, but unfortunately he left his work incomplete.
In his dedication to Queen Elizabeth
he <span class="lock">says&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“What great account (most gracious Soueraigne) hath
beene made of godly bookes, may euidently appeare by
the value set uppon the bookes of curious actes brought to
the Apostles feete to be burnt. For if those bookes were
valued to two thousand markes, of what estimation shall
wee account the bookes whose author is God himselfe ...
all the goods upon the earth cannot value them.”</p></div>

<p>It is remarkable how difficult it must have been
in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries to obtain
information respecting new books. There were no
public libraries, and the booksellers, according to
Maunsell, were not well acquainted with the titles
of the books published, and he constantly refers to
the scarceness of books issued only a few years
before. He <span class="lock">writes&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“And seeing also many singular Bookes, not only of
Diuinitie, but of other excellent Arts, after the first impression,
so spent and gone, that they lie euen as it were buried
in some few Studies. That men desirous of such kind of
Bookes, cannot aske for that they neuer heard of, and the
Bookeseller cannot shew that he hath not: I have thought
good in my poor estate to undertake this most tiresome
business, hoping the Lord will send a blessing on my
labours taken in my vocation. Thinking it as necessarie
for the Bookeseller (considering the number and nature of
them) to haue a Catalogue of our English Bookes as the
Apothecaire his Dispensatorium or the Schoolmaster his

draw to your memories Bookes that you could not remember
and shew to the learind such Bookes as they
would not thinke were in our owne tongues....”</p></div>

<p>Besides dedicating his book to Queen Elizabeth,
he addresses “the Companie of Stationers, and all
other printers and booksellers,” to whom he <span class="lock">says&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have in my vocation laboured to do somwhat: my

<p>To the reverend divines he <span class="lock">says&mdash;</span></p>

yet most toylesome &amp; troublesome busines, wherby the
reader shall haue this help, and he may see at home in his
Studie what Bookes are written and how many translated.
And though it be imperfect as I know not what first Booke
either of Dictionarie or Herball or such like was perfect at
the first or second edition, yet he that helpeth me to put in
one Booke that I have not seene, I hope I shall shew him
ten that he never heard of either new or old.”</p></div>

<p>The second part of Maunsell’s catalogue was
dedicated to Robert, Earl of Essex, and the scarceness
of books not twenty or forty years old is again
referred to in <span class="lock">it&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Seeing still many excellent Bookes written and printed
in our owne tongue, and that many of them after twenty
or fortie yeares Printing are so dispersed out of Bookesellers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
hands, that they are not onely scarce to be found but almost
quite forgotten, I have thought it worth my poore labour,
to take some paynes heerin (though that the more learnd
sort would not willingly imploy their labour in the same)
to gather a Cathalogue in suche sort as I can of the Bookes
printed in our tongue which I doe hope will be delightsome
to all English men that be learnt or desirous of

<p>The next bibliography of new English books was
William London’s “Catalogue of the most vendible
Books,” 1658, to which two small supplements were
published, bringing the list of publications down to
1660.</p>

<p>R. Clavel was the next to publish a catalogue of
new books, and the period covered by him was
from 1666 to 1695. To none of these books are
prices attached, but some of the books in Clavel’s
supplement are priced; and in the monthly catalogue
commenced by Bernard Lintott in May 1714,
all the books are priced.</p>

<p>Bent’s General Catalogue of Books, issued in
1786, contained the titles of books published since
1700, and this was succeeded by the London Catalogue,
which appeared for several years. The
British and English catalogues followed, and the
latter is published annually.</p>

<p>In order to obtain some idea of the varying
prices at which books have been published, it will
be well to enumerate a few at different periods,
arranged under the different sizes of books.</p>

<h3>FOLIOS</h3>

<p>Corpus Christi College, Oxford, gave seven shillings
in 1621 for Bacon’s work on Henry VII., and
in 1624 £3, 6s. 8d. for four volumes of “Purchas’s
Pilgrims.” The published price of the first edition
of Shakespeare’s Plays is said to have been £1.</p>

<p>John Ogilby, who was one of the first projectors
of grand illustrated books in large folio, found
himself burthened with a heavy stock of expensive
books which did not sell, so he hit upon the expedient
of getting rid of them by means of a lottery,
licensed by the Duke of York and the Assistants
of the Corporation of the Royal Fishery. These
books were an illustrated Bible, printed by John
Field at Cambridge in 1660, two volumes folio; the
“Works of Virgil,” translated by Ogilby, 1654;
Homer’s “Iliads,” translated by Ogilby, 1660;
Homer’s “Odysseys,” 1665. Pope frequently spoke
in later life of the great pleasure Ogilby’s “Homer”
gave him when a boy at school. “Æsop’s Fables
paraphrased by Ogilby,” 1665; and Ogilby’s “Entertainment
of Charles II. in his Passage through the
City of London to his Coronation,” 1662&mdash;a splendid
book, which is said to have proved of great
service in succeeding coronations.</p>

<p>It is worthy of note that Samuel Pepys was a
subscriber to the lottery, and obtained the “Æsop”
and the “Coronation,” which cost him £4 (Feb.
19, 1665-66).</p>

<p>Ogilby issued a Proposal for a second lottery,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
which was reprinted in the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i>
(1814, part 1, pp. 646-48).<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> This is valuable as

<p>In 1689 St. John’s College, Cambridge, gave
£10, 15s. for David Loggan’s <i>Cantabrigia illustrata</i>,
1688, but this probably included a present to the
author; for in 1690 Eton College paid £4 for
<i>Cantabrigia illustrata</i> and <i>Oxonia illustrata</i>, 1675,
two volumes together, so that we may suppose the
published price of each to be £2.</p>

<p>The Rev. John Flavel’s Works, in two volumes
folio, was published in 1700 for forty shillings, which
shows that the price of an illustrated volume in
folio was still about £1.</p>

<p>Colin Campbell’s <i>Vitruvius Britannicus</i>, a handsome
work containing a large number of fine architectural
plates, was published at a very reasonable
price. The first and second volumes, published
in 1715 and 1717 respectively, were sold for four
guineas on imperial paper, and three guineas on
royal paper.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>
<p>The price of Johnson’s Dictionary of the English
Language, two volumes folio, was in 1755 four
guineas in sheets, and £4, 15s. in boards.</p>

<p>Folios are so completely out of fashion now,
except for gorgeously illustrated books, or for facsimiles
of books and documents, that it is scarcely
worth while to carry the inquiry to a later period.</p>


<h3>QUARTOS</h3>

<p>The small quarto volumes of the seventeenth
century were by no means high priced, and we
learn that three shillings bought Milton’s “Paradise
Lost” when first published. The price of the early
editions of the separate plays of the Elizabethan
dramatists, which now are so much sought after,
was sixpence. This we learn from the address
prefixed to the early issue of “Troilus and Cressida,”
1609, published before that play was <span class="lock">acted&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Amongst all these is none more witty than this; and
had I time, I would comment upon it, though I know it
needs not&mdash;for so much as will make you think your <i>testern</i>
well bestowed,&mdash;but for so much worth as even poor I know
to be stuffed in it.”</p></div>

<p>The poets had a profitable time when their poems,
handsomely printed in quarto volumes, were priced
so high as two guineas. Sir Walter Scott made
great sums by these editions which sold in large
numbers, but no other poet was so fortunate as he
was. Moore did well with his poems, and in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
Diary (Dec. 23, 1818) he records an amusing instance
of the practical appreciation of an admirer.
He <span class="lock">writes&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The young Bristol lady who enclosed me £3 after
reading ‘Lalla Rookh’ had very laudable ideas on the
subject; and if every reader of ‘Lalla Rookh’ had done
the same, I need never have written again.”</p></div>

<p>Wordsworth’s “Excursion” was published in
1814, in a two guinea quarto volume, but it took
six years to exhaust an edition of five hundred
copies. Such are the inequalities in the rate of
the remuneration of authors.</p>

<p>Rees’s “Cyclopædia,” which was published between
1802 and 1820 (in forty-five volumes and
six volumes of plates), cost in all £85. The “Encyclopædia
Britannica,” which has superseded it,
is published at the small price of twenty-eight
shillings per volume.</p>

<p>In the early part of this century, when it was the
fashion to print standard works in quarto, they
were very high priced, thus the first edition of
“Pepys’s Diary” was published in two volumes
for six guineas. Now the quarto is almost as much
out of date as the folio, and is confined to illustrated
books.</p>


<h3>OCTAVOS</h3>

<p>The ordinary octavo volume was published at
the beginning of the eighteenth century for five
or six shillings. Thus Boyer’s translation of “The
ingenious and entertaining Memoirs of Count<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Gramont, who lived in the court of King Charles II.,
and was afterwards Ambassador from the King
of France to King James II.,” 1714, was published
at five shillings, and George Psalmanazar’s “Historical
and Geographical Description of Formosa”
at six shillings. Since then the price for an octavo
has gradually increased to seven shillings and sixpence,
then to ten shillings and sixpence. In the
latter half of the present century there has been a
considerable advance to twelve shillings, to sixteen
and eighteen shillings, and now fully illustrated
books are often priced as high as one guinea a
volume. Plays, trials, and pamphlets generally
have averaged about one shilling apiece.</p>


<h3>DUODECIMOS</h3>

<p>Walton’s “Complete Angler,” first published in
1653, was issued at one shilling and sixpence, as
appears from the following contemporary advertisement,
quoted by Hone in his “Every-Day Book”:
“There is published a Booke of Eighteen-pence
price, called ‘The Compleat Angler; or, The Contemplative
Man’s Recreation,’ being a Discourse
of Fish and Fishing. Not unworthy the perusall.
Sold by Richard Marriot at S. Dunstan’s Churchyard,
Fleet Street.”</p>

<p>In 1663 Pepys bought the first part of Butler’s
“Hudibras” for two shillings and sixpence, and
sold it again for one shilling and sixpence. The
Master of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, gave at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
the same time one shilling for the first part and
the same sum for the second part, but later on
he gave half-a-crown for the latter.</p>

<p>“The Works of the celebrated Mons. de Molière,
translated from the last edition printed at Paris,
containing his life, all his comedies, interludes, &amp;c.,
with a large account of his life and remarkable
death, who, as he was acting the part of Death in
one of his own plays, was taken ill and died a few
hours after....” This was printed in six volumes
12mo, “on a fine paper and Elzevir letter,” and
published by B. Lintott for fifteen shillings (or
two shillings and sixpence a volume) in May 1714.</p>

<p>Tom D’Urfey sold his “Wit and Mirth; or, Pills
to purge Melancholy,” at two shillings and sixpence
a volume.</p>

<p>Duodecimos have now gone out of fashion, at
least in name, as small books are mostly known
as post octavos, foolscap octavos, &amp;c. The price
of these small handy volumes remains much the
same, as the half-crown of the last century is the
equivalent of our five or six shillings.</p>

<p>The greatest change in price has been made in
poetry and novels, and six shillings has become a
favourite price for both. The two guineas for the
poem, and the guinea and a half for the three-volume
novel, are become things of the past.</p>

<p>Although in the last century many books were
published and sold which could not be sold at the
present time, it is probable that some of these
books paid the publisher but badly, and it was
therefore found to be a wise precaution to publish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
certain books by subscription, and this plan was
therefore frequently adopted.</p>

<p>Dr. Brian Walton’s Polyglot Bible (six vols.
folio, 1657, £10) is often said to be the first book
printed by subscription in England; but Minsheu’s
Dictionary, in eleven languages, 1617, was certainly
sold by the author to subscribers. The number
of these subscribers was 174, among whom are
six&mdash;viz., Sir John Laurence, Dr. Aileworth, Mr.
Paul Peart, Mr. Brigges, Sir Henry Spelman, and
Mr. Booth&mdash;who largely assisted the author with
money to complete his great undertaking.</p>

<p>“The Monthly Catalogue” of new books commenced
by Bernard Lintott in May 1714 frequently
contained lists of the books printed by subscription.
In the number for January 1714-15 the terms of
subscription to the worst edition of Chaucer’s works
ever published are <span class="lock">announced&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Whereas John Urry, Student of Christ-Church, Oxon,
has obtained from her late Majesty, Queen Anne, a Licence
for Printing the Works of the celebrated Jeffrey Chaucer,
corrected from all the printed editions, and from several
rare and ancient MSS. not hitherto consulted: from the
collating of which he has restored many single lines and
added several Tales never yet printed, by which alterations,
amendments, and additions, the work is in a manner become
new. Thirty copper plates by the best gravers will
be printed before each tale; a more compleat Glossary and
Table will be added at the end. A small number will be
printed on Royal Paper at 50s. per book, and those on the
finest demy at 30s. Half to be paid in hand. Subscriptions
are taken in by the Undertaker, Bernard Lintott<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
between the Temple Gates, and by most Booksellers in
London and the country. <i>N.B.</i>&mdash;A new Black Letter,
accented, has been cast on purpose for this work, for the
ease of the Reader.”</p></div>

<p>Dryden made very good terms with Tonson for
the publication of his translation of Virgil, but Pope
was still more successful with the subscription to
his translation of Homer’s “Iliad.” The subscription
for six quarto volumes was fixed at six guineas,
and 575 persons subscribed for 654 copies. The
booksellers eagerly made their offers of publication,
and the highest bidder was B. Lintott, who agreed
to supply all the subscription copies at his own
expense, and to pay £200 for every volume. Pope
therefore received altogether £5320 without any
deduction.</p>

<p>Lintott engaged not to print any quartos except
for Pope, but he printed the quarto pages on small
folio, and sold each volume for half-a-guinea. These
being cut down by some dishonest traders, were
sold as subscription copies.</p>

<p>Lintott was defrauded of his profit by the sale
of a duodecimo edition, printed in Holland, which
obliged him to print an edition in a similar form.
Of Lintott’s first duodecimo edition 2500 copies
were quickly sold off. Five thousand further copies
were at once printed.</p>

<p>Some of Hearne’s antiquarian works were subscribed
at ten shillings and sixpence per volume
for small paper, and one guinea for large paper.</p>

<p>It seems to have been the practice for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
subscriber to a book to pay down half the purchase-money
on sending in his name, and the other half
on publication.</p>

<p>Another expedient for the rapid sale of books
was their issue in numbers. Smollett’s “History
of England” was published in sixpenny numbers,
and had an immediate sale of 20,000 copies. This
immense success is said to have been due to an
artifice practised by the publisher. He sent down
a packet of prospectuses carriage free (with half-a-crown
enclosed) to every parish clerk in the kingdom,
to be distributed by him through the pews
of the church. This being generally carried out, a
valuable advertisement was obtained, which resulted
in an extensive demand for the work.</p>

<p>Books are published at an equal price, according
to size, whether they are good or bad, but they find
their level in the catalogues of the second-hand
booksellers. The bad soon become waste-paper,
or are marked down to very low prices, while the
good books increase in price till they come in
some cases to be marked more than the original
published price.</p>

<p>Sometimes when books are printed in limited
numbers the public will give more than the published
price even before publication; thus the large
paper edition of the “Life of the Queen,” by Mr.
R. R. Holmes, was subscribed at £8, and the right
of receiving a copy when ready is said to have been
sold for from £20 to £25.</p>

<p>Publishers occasionally reduce the price of
a book after publication, but this is seldom a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
successful operation. The selling-off of remainders
has been the means of distributing books to the
public at a low rate, and it will often be found that
some of the scarcest and highest priced books in
the present day are those which have been sold-off.
These were good books, which sold too slowly, but
which went off quickly when the price was low.
When the stock is exhausted, and more are required,
the price naturally goes up.</p>

<p>A most remarkable instance of this increase in
price of a sold-off book is that of Edward Fitzgerald’s
wonderful version of the <i>Rubáiyát</i> of Omar
Khayyam, the first edition of which was published
by Quaritch in 1859. Though the number
printed was few, nobody bought, and eight years
afterwards the publisher, in disgust, threw the
whole remainder into a box outside his door, and
marked all these one penny each. It is said that
Dante Rossetti found them there, and soon the
remainder was exhausted. Now this penny book
is worth six guineas.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V<br />

<span class="smaller">AUCTION SALES IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY</span></h2>


<p>The exact date of the first introduction into
England of the convenient plan of selling books
by auction is known to us through the amiable
weakness of the auctioneers for writing prefaces to
the sale catalogues; and this history, therefore, is
singularly unlike that of most other inventions and
customs, the origin of which is usually open to
doubt, because the originators have not thought it
worth while to explain that they were doing some
new thing. The auctioneers, on the other hand, tell
us which was the first sale, and which were the
second, the third, and the fourth. After this the
freshness may be said to be exhausted, and we are
contented with less exact particulars.</p>

<p>The custom was prevalent in Holland in the
middle of the seventeenth century, and the honour
of introducing it into England is due to William
Cooper, the bookseller of Little Britain, about
whom some notice has been given in a former
chapter. He was largely interested in alchemy,
and three years before he sold his first sale he
published a “Catalogue of Chemical Books.”</p>

<p>We must not, however, suppose that this was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
introduction of auctions into England, for sale by
inch of candle had long been practised here, a plan
adopted by the Navy Office for the sale of their old
stores.</p>

<p>The earliest use of the word auction, quoted by
Dr. Murray in the “New English Dictionary,” is
from Warner’s translation of Plautus, 1595: “The
auction of Menæchmus, ... when will be sold
slaves, household goods,” &amp;c.; and the next quotation
is from the Appendix to Phillip’s Dictionary,
1678: “<i>Auction</i>, a making a publick sale and selling
of goods by an outcry.” We shall see that the word
was far from familiar to the general public, as the
auctioneers considered it wise to explain the word,
thus: “Sale of books by way of auction, or who
will give most for them.” The more usual words
in old English were outcry, outrope (still familiar
in Scotland as <i>roup</i>, <i>cf.</i> German <i>ruf</i>) and port sale.</p>

<p>The first sale by auction was that of the library
of Lazarus Seaman, a member of the Assembly of
Divines, and chaplain to the Earl of Northumberland.
He was also minister of All Hallows, Bread
Street, and Master of Peterhouse, Cambridge. In
the latter college a Diary written by him between
1645 and 1657 is preserved. He seems to have been
an active man on his own side in politics, and we
find that he was a member of the Committee for
ejecting Scandalous Ministers for London and the
Counties of Cambridge and Huntingdon. It is
therefore not surprising to find that at the Restoration
he was ejected both from his living and from
the Mastership of Peterhouse. He died at his house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
in Warwick Court, London, in September 1675, and
in the following year his library was sold in his
house by Cooper, who makes the following interesting
remarks in his <span class="lock">preface&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Reader, it hath not been usual here in England to make
sale of Books by way of auction, or who will give most for
them: But it having been practised in other countreys to
the advantage both of buyers and sellers, it was therefore
conceived (for the encouragement of Learning) to publish
the sale of these Books this manner of way, and it is hoped
that this will not be unacceptable to Schollers....”</p></div>

<p>Mr. Alfred W. Pollard, in a very valuable article
on English Book Sales, 1676-80 (<i>Bibliographica</i>, vol.
i. p. 373), quotes an interesting letter from David
Millington to Joseph Hill, an English Nonconformist
minister in Holland, dated June 1697, and
now preserved in the British Museum (Stowe MS.,
709), in which the writer tenders to the divine his
thanks for the “great service done to learning and
learned men in your first advising and effectually
setting on foot that admirable and universally
approved way of selling librarys amongst us;”
and distinctly states that it was Hill who “happily
introduced the practice into England.” Mr. Pollard
goes on to say that “Hill, who from 1673 to 1678,
owing to his publication of a pamphlet which gave
offence to the Dutch Government, was resident in
England, must have advised the executors of Dr.
Seaman, a theologian of principles not widely
different from his own, to adopt this method of
selling his friend’s library to the best advantage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>”
Seaman was the author of “A Vindication of the
Judgement of the Reformed Churches, &amp;c., concerning
Ordination, &amp;c.,” 1647, and the chief class of
books in his library was what we might expect to
find, viz., theological works that he required in his
vocation. Some few books (such as the Eliot Bible
of 1661-63, nineteen shillings) fetched small prices
as compared with their present value, but Mr.
Pollard says that “nine-tenths of the books sold for
more than they would at the present day.”</p>

<p>The library was a large one, and the lots numbered
between five and six thousand, and the
amount realised by the sale was a little over £700,
which may be roughly estimated at about £3500 of
our present money.</p>

<p>The second auction sale (February 1676-67) was
also carried out by Cooper, and consisted of the
library of Thomas Kidner, Rector of Hitchin, in
Hertfordshire, who died 31st August 1676. The
library, like that of Dr. Seaman, consisted largely
of theological works. It is evident from Cooper’s
preface to this catalogue that Seaman’s sale had
given considerable satisfaction, although the reference
to an attempt to stifle this manner of sale
shows that there were some opponents of the
system. Cooper <span class="lock">writes&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Reader, the first attempt in this kind (by the Sale of
Dr. Seaman’s library) having given great content and
satisfaction to the gentlemen who were buyers, and no
great discouragement to the Sellers, hath encouraged the
making this second trial, by the exposing (to auction or sale)
the Library of Mr. Tho. Kidner, in hopes of receiving such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
encouragement from the Learned as may prevent the stifling
of this manner of sale, the benefit (if rightly considered)
being equally balanced between buyer and seller.”</p></div>

<p>The third sale (February 1677-78) was of the
library of Thomas Greenhill, a Nonconformist
minister of some repute, who died in 1671, seven
years before his books were sold. This sale is
worthy of note, for the auctioneer was Zachariah
Bourne, and not Cooper, as in the two former cases.
It took place at the Turk’s Head Coffee-House in
Bread Street (in ædibus Ferdinandi Stable, Coffipolæ,
ad insigne Capitis Turcæ). Bourne states in
his preface <span class="lock">that&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The attempts in this kind having given great content
and satisfaction to the gentlemen who were the buyers
and no discouragement to the sellers, hath encouraged the
making this trial by exposing (to auction or sale) the
library of Mr. William Greenhill.”</p></div>

<p>The fourth sale (25th May 1678) was occupied
with the library of Thomas Manton (1620-77), one
of the ministers appointed to wait upon Charles II.
at Breda. It took place at the house of the late
possessor, in King Street, Covent Garden. More
English literature was included in this library than
in the former three. The auctioneer was Cooper,
and his preface is worth quoting. It will be seen
that the plan of allowing an inspection of the books
before the sale had now been <span class="lock">adopted&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Reader, we question not but that this manner of sale
by way of auction is pretty well known to the Learned, nor
can we doubt their encouragement for the advantage which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
they (as well as we) may in time reap thereby. Wherefore
we are resolved (<i>Deo volente</i>) to make a fourth triall
with the Library of Dr. Tho. Manton, which is not contemptible
either for the Value, Condition, or Number, as will
appear upon a sight thereof, which is free for any Gentleman
that shall please to take that pains.”</p></div>

<p>Cooper was not satisfied with the catalogue,
which had been made by one considered by him
to be incompetent, and of whom he writes <span class="lock">thus&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This Catalogue was taken by Phil Briggs, and not by
W. Cooper, but afterwards in parts methodized by him.
Wherefore he craves your excuse for the mistakes that have
hapned; and desires that the Saddle may be laid upon the
right horse.”</p></div>

<p>The sale of Benjamin Worsley’s library (May
1678) is interesting, as being the first auction in
which a fair representation of old English literature
occurs, in addition to the ordinary theological
works. Chaucer (1602) fetched £1, 3s. 6d.; Ben
Jonson’s Works (1640), £1, 13s. 6d.; Shakespeare,
second folio, 16s., and third folio, £1, 8s. 6d. The
auctioneers were John Dunsmore and Richard Chiswell,
and the sale took place over against the Hen
and Chickens, in Paternoster Row. The sixth sale
consisted of the libraries of John Godolphin and
Owen Philips, and took place in November 1678,
when a Caxton&mdash;“Geffrey Chaucer’s translation of
Boethius’ <i>De Consolatione Philosophiæ</i> in English”&mdash;fetched
five shillings. We thus see that in two
years there were only six sales. After this time
they became more frequent, and in this same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
month of November 1678 an attempt was made at
rigging a sale; the booksellers were so well satisfied
with the prices obtained, that they thought it
would be a good stroke of business to lift some of
their old stock under the cover of a good name.
Moses Pitt adopted this expedient, and issued a
catalogue of books described as including “the
library of a worthy and learned person deceased,
with a considerable number of the choice books of
most sciences, some of which have been bought
out of the best libraries abroad, particularly out of
the late famous and learned Gilbert Voetius’s.”</p>

<p>This fraud was greatly resented by the book-buyers,
and it was felt by the other auctioneers
that a blow had been dealt to the newly-established
system of sale; so when in December of this same
year the libraries of Lord Warwick and Gabriel
Sangar came to be sold at the Harrow, over
against the College of Physicians, in Warwick
Lane, Nathaniel Ranew, the auctioneer, thought it
expedient to make a statement in the preface to
the catalogue, where he informed his patrons that
this is “no collection made by any private hand
(which hath been imputed to some auctions as a
reflection), but the works were really belonging to
their proprietors deceased mentioned on the title-page,
and by the direction of their respective executors
exposed to sale.”</p>

<p>Moses Pitt made up another sale in February
1678-79, chiefly of books printed at the Sheldonian
Theatre, Oxford, which took place in Petty Canons
Hall, near St. Paul’s Churchyard. In June 1679<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
William Cooper sold the libraries of Stephen Watkins
and Dr. Thomas Shirley (the catalogue of
which contained an appendix of Richard Chiswell’s
books) at the Golden Lion, over against the Queen’s
Head Tavern, in Paternoster Row. John Dunsmore
sold in November 1679 the library of Sir Edward
Bysshe, Clarenceux King at Arms, at his house,
near the sign of the Woolpack, in Ivy Lane. This
library was more varied in its character than many
of those that were sold before it, and it contained
a considerable amount of French, Italian, and
Spanish literature, including some early editions of
Molière. This catalogue is deserving of particular
attention, because the books are described as
“curiously bound and richly gilt.” Hitherto no
mention had been made of bindings in the various
catalogues. This attention to binding was to grow,
and Thomas Hearne protested against it some
years after. In his memoranda under date 15th
February 1725-26 he wrote respecting the sale of
John Bridges’ library: “I hear they go very high,
being fair books in good condition, and most of
them finely bound. This afternoon I was told of
a gentleman of All Souls’ College (I suppose Dr.
Clarke) that gave a commission of eight shillings
for a Homer in two vols., a small 8vo, if not 12mo.
But it went for six guineas. People are in love
with good binding more than good reading.”<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></p>

<p>The British Museum Library contains a valuable
collection of early sale catalogues, and one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
volumes, containing the first eleven sales from Seaman
to Bysshe, is of considerable interest from
having the following note in Richard Heber’s <span class="lock">handwriting&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This volume, which formerly belonged to Narcissus
Luttrell, and since to Mr. Gough, is remarkable for containing
the eleven first Catalogues of Books ever sold by
auction in England. What renders it still more curious, is
that the prices of nearly all the articles are added in MS.
When it came into my possession it had suffered so much
from damp, and the leaves were so tender and rotten, that
every time the volume was opened, it was liable to injury.
This has been remedied by giving the whole a strong
coat of size. At Willett’s sale, Booth, the bookseller of
Duke Street, Portland Place, bought a volume of old
catalogues for £2, 3s. (see Merly Catalogue, 531), and
charged the same in his own shop catalogue for 1815, £21
(6823). It contained merely the eight which stand first
in the present collection, of which Greenhill’s and Godolphin’s
were not priced at all; and Voet’s and Sangar’s only
partially. However, it enabled me to fill up a few omissions
in the prices of my copy of Sangar’s.&mdash;<i>N.B.</i> The
prices of Willett’s and the present copy did not always
tally exactly.”</p></div>

<p>Heber paid six shillings for this volume at Gough’s
sale in 1810, and Charles Lewis’s labours in sizing
and binding in 1824 cost £2, 15s. At Heber’s sale
the volume sold for £3.</p>

<p>In April 1680 was sold “the Library of the Right
Hon. George, late Earl of Bristol, a great part of
which were the curiosities collected by the learned
Sir Kenelm Digby, together with the Library of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
another Learned person.” It is impossible from
the catalogue to tell which lots belonged to Sir
Kenelm; and there seems to be little doubt that
few of the books which he left in Paris when he
came to London, and which were confiscated by
the French Government on his death in 1665, were
included in this catalogue. According to M.
Delisle,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> Sir Kenelm’s books eventually reached the
French national library. The proceeds of the sale
of 3878 lots was only £908, and this does not look
as if there were many of Digby’s books, nobly
bound by Le Gascon, in this sale.</p>

<p>In 1681 Edward Millington’s name came into
notice as the seller, in May of that year, of the
libraries of Lawson, Fawkes, Stockden, and Brooks.</p>

<p>Richard Chiswell sold in 1682 the <i>Bibliotheca
Smithiana</i>, or library of Richard Smith, Secondary
of the Poultry Compter, who is better known to us
as the author of the useful “Obituary” published
by the Camden Society in 1849. This was probably
the finest library brought to the hammer up
to this date. Oldys wrote of the possessor, that
“for many years together [he] suffered nothing to
escape him that was rare and remarkable”; and he
added, that his “extraordinary library makes perhaps
the richest catalogue of any private library we
have to show in print, making above four hundred
pages in a very broad-leaved and close-printed
quarto.” Richard Chiswell sold the library in May<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
“at the auction house known by the name of the
Swan, in Great St. Bartholomew’s Close.”</p>

<p>The auctioneer made the following remarks in
his Address to the <span class="lock">Reader&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Though it be needless to recommend what to all intelligent
persons sufficiently commends itself, yet perhaps
it may not be unacceptable to the ingenious to have some
short account concerning this so much celebrated, so often
desired, so long expected library, now exposed to sale.
The gentleman that collected it was a person infinitely
curious and inquisitive after books; and who suffered
nothing considerable to escape him that fell within the
compass of his learning, for he had not the vanity of
desiring to be master of more than he knew how to use.
He lived to a very great age, and spent a good part of it
almost entirely in the search of books. Being as constantly
known every day to walk his rounds through the shops as
he sat down to meals, where his great skill and experience
enabled him to make choice of what was not obvious to
every vulgar eye. He lived in times which ministered
peculiar opportunities of meeting with books that are not
every day brought into publick light; and few eminent
libraries were bought where he had not the liberty to pick
and choose. And while others were forming arms, and
new-modelling kingdoms, his great ambition was to become
master of a good book. Hence arose, as that vast number
of his books, so the choiceness and rarity of the greatest
part of them; and that of all kinds, and in all sorts of
learning.... Nor was the owner of them a meer idle
possessor of so great a treasure; for as he generally collated
his books upon the buying them (upon which account the
buyer may rest pretty secure of their being perfect) so he
did not barely turn over the leaves, but observed the defects
of impression, and the ill acts used by many; compared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
the differences of editions; concerning which and the like
cases, he has entered memorable and very useful remarks
upon very many of the books under his own hand: observations
wherein, certainly never man was more diligent and
industrious. Thus much was thought fit to be communicated
to public notice, by a gentleman who was intimately
acquainted both with Mr. Smith and his books.”</p></div>

<p>Dibdin condemns the compiler of the catalogue
severely, and <span class="lock">adds&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A number of the most curious, rare, and intrinsically
valuable books&mdash;the very insertion of which in a bookseller’s
catalogue would probably now make a hundred
bibliomaniacs start from their homes by starlight, in order
to come in for the first picking&mdash;a number of volumes of
this description are huddled together in one lot, and all
these classed under the provoking running title of ‘Bundles
of Books,’ ‘Bundles of stitcht Books.’”<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></p></div>

<p>Smith was one of the earliest collectors of Caxtons,
and eleven books produced by our first printer sold
for £3, 4s. 2d. at his sale. But one of the greatest
points of interest connected with Smith’s library is
that it included the books of Humphrey Dyson,
collected at a much earlier date. Hearne notes in
his <span class="lock">“Collections”&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“That Mr. Rich. Smith’s rare and curious collection of
books was began first by Mr. Humphrey Dyson, a publick
notary, living in the Poultry. They came to Mr. Smith by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
marriage. This is the same Humphrey Dyson that assisted
Howes in his continuation of Stow’s ‘Survey of London,’
ed. folio.”</p></div>

<p>Under date 4th September 1715 Hearne <span class="lock">says&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mr. Richard Smith’s Catalogue that is printed contains
a very noble and very extraordinary collection of books.
It was begun first in the time of King Hen. VIII., and
comeing to Mr. Smith, he was so very diligent and exact in
continueing and improving, that hardly anything curious
escaped him. He had made the best collection that possibly
he could of Erasmus’s works.”<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></p></div>

<p>In another place Hearne describes Dyson <span class="lock">as&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A person of a very strange, prying, and inquisitive
genius in the matter of books, as may appear from many
libraries; there being books chiefly in old English, almost
in every library, that have belonged to him, with his name
upon them.”<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">42</a></p>
</div>

<p>The following interesting entry from Smith’s
catalogue corroborates Hearne’s statement as to
Smith’s acquisition of Dyson’s <span class="lock">books&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“115. Six several catalogues of all such books, touching
the state ecclesiastical as temporal of the realm of England,
which were published upon several occasions, in the reigns
of K. Henry the VIIth and VIIIth, Philip and Mary, Q.
Elizabeth, K. James and Charles I., collected by Mr. H.
Dyson: out of whose library was gathered by Mr. Smith
a great part of the rarities of this catalogue.”</p>
</div>

<p>This lot only fetched seven shillings and sixpence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>The number of sales seem now to have increased
annually, but it was some years before a library that
could rank with Richard Smith’s was sold. In April
1683 the books of Brian Walton, Bishop of Chester,
were sold (twenty-two years after his death) “by
Samuel Carr, at his house of the King’s Head in
St. Paul’s Churchyard.” About this time auction
sales took place in various parts of the country,
and Edward Millington was largely employed as
a peripatetic auctioneer. In September 1684 he
sold books at Stourbridge Fair (<i>Bibliotheca Sturbitchiana</i>).
In 1686 two sales occurred at Trumpington
(Obadiah Sedgwick in March, and William Whitwood
in May) and two at Cambridge (Dr. Edmond
Castell in June, and Rev. J. Chamberlaine, of St.
John’s College, at Stourbridge Fair, in September).
When we forget the change that has taken place in
the value of money, and express our surprise that
rare books should only realise a few shillings, we
should note that the cost of the hire of thirteen
carts for conveying Dr. Castell’s books from
Emmanuel College to the sign of the Eagle and
Child, where they were sold, was only three shillings.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">43</a>
In 1685 and 1686 occurred the famous sales
of the stock of Richard Davis, the Oxford bookseller,
which was satirised in the <i>Auctio Davisiana</i>,
noticed in an earlier chapter.</p>

<p>In 1682 William Cooper published a list of book-sales
up to that date, and again a fuller list in 1687,
which contained a note of seventy-four sales in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
ten years 1676-86. The following note is printed
on the back of page 33 of <i>Catalogus Librorum Bibliothecæ
viri cujusdam Literati</i>, 14th February <span class="lock">1686-87&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“To gratifie those Gentlemen whose curiosities may lead
them to make perfect their Collection, I have caused to be
printed the names of those persons whose libraries have
been sold by auction, and the series of the time when”
[1676-1686].</p></div>

<p>This list is reprinted by Hartshorne in his “Book
Rarities of the University of Cambridge,” 1829 (pp.
454-57), and it forms the text for two excellent
articles by Mr. A. W. Pollard in <i>Bibliographica</i>.</p>

<p>In 1687 Millington sold the valuable library of
Dr. Thomas Jacomb, a Nonconformist minister
(<i>Bibliotheca Jacombiana</i>), which realised £1300; and
in February of the following year the library of a
counsellor of the Parliaments of Montpelier, which
had been brought from France to be sold in England
(<i>Bibliotheca Mascoviana</i>).</p>

<p>T. Bentley and B. Walford sold in November 1687
an interesting library of an anonymous but distinguished
defunct&mdash;<i>Bibliotheca Illustrissima</i>, which
is described as follows in the Address to the
<span class="lock">Reader&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If the catalogue here presented were only of common
books and such as were easie to be had, it would not have
been very necessary to have prefaced anything to the reader;
but since it appears in the world with circumstances which
no auction in England (perhaps) ever had before, nor is it
probable that the like should frequently happen again, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
would seem an oversight if we should neglect to advertise
the reader of them. The first is, that it comprises the main
part of the library of that famous secretary, William Cecil,
Lord Burleigh: which considered, must put it out of doubt
that these books are excellent in their several kinds and
well chosen. The second is, that it contains a greater
number of rare manuscripts than ever yet were offered
together in this way, many of which are rendered the
more valuable by being remarked upon by the hand of the
said great man.”</p></div>

<p>A considerable number of sales took place between
this date and the end of the century, but few
were of any particular mark until the fine library of
Dr. Francis Bernard came to the hammer in 1698.</p>

<p>Millington continued his travels in the country,
and sold, among others, the library of Mrs. Elizabeth
Oliver at Norwich in 1689, and some modern
English books at Abingdon in 1692; and John
Howell sold the Rev. George Ashwell’s library at
Oxford in 1696.</p>

<p>Dr. Francis Bernard, physician to St. Bartholomew’s
Hospital, was also physician to James II.
He was a good judge of books, and collected a very
fine library, which was sold by auction in October
1698 at his late dwelling in Little Britain. Dibdin
says he was “a stoic in bibliography. Neither
beautiful binding nor amplitude of margin ever
delighted his eye or rejoiced his heart; for he was
a stiff and straightforward reader, and learned in
literary history beyond all his contemporaries. His
collection was copious and excellent.”</p>

<p>The account given of the doctor in the Address<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
to the Reader prefixed to the catalogue is of considerable
<span class="lock">interest&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The character of the person whose collection this was
is so well known, that there is no occasion to say much of
him, nor, to any man of judgment that inspects the Catalogue,
of the collection itself. Something, however, it
becomes us to say of both; and this, I think, may with
truth and modesty enough be said, that as few men knew
books, and that part of learning which is called <i>Historia
Literaria</i>, better than himself, so there never appeared in
England so choice and valuable a Catalogue to be thus
disposed of as this before us. Certain it is, this library
contains not a few which never appeared in any auction
here before, nor indeed, as I have heard him say, for aught
he knew&mdash;and he knew as well as any man living&mdash;in any
printed Catalogue in the world. It was very seldom that
he bought any book without some very particular reason.
For if any man died, he certainly knew what we call the
secret history of learning so well, that if there were but
one single passage in an author for which only it was to
be valued, it never escaped him. Being a person who collected
his books, and not for ostentation or ornament, he
seemed no more solicitous about their dress than his own;
and therefore you’ll find that a gilt back or a large margin
was very seldom any inducement to him to buy. ’Twas
sufficient to him that he had the book.... He himself
was not a mere nomenclator, and versed only in title-pages,
but had made that just and laudable use of his books which
would become all those that set up for collectors....
Give me leave to say this of him upon my own knowledge,
that he never grudged his money in procuring, nor his time
or labour in perusing any book which he thought could be
any ways instructive to him; and having the felicity of a
memory always faithful, always officious, which never forsook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
him, though attacked by frequent and severe sickness,
and by the worst of all diseases, old age, his desire for
knowledge attended him to the last, and he pursued his
studies with equal vigour and application to the very
extremity of his life.”</p></div>

<p>He had thirteen Caxtons, which sold altogether
for less than two guineas, less than these books
fetched at Richard Smith’s sale. A curious volume
of Tracts, consisting of “The Bellman’s Night
Walks” (1632), “The Bellman of London” (1608),
“Life of Ned Browne,” “Cut Purse,” &amp;c., sold for
2s. 8d.; Stubbe’s “Anatomie of Abuses” (1585),
for 8d.; and Tusser’s “Five Hundred Points of
Good Husbandry” (1590) for 4d. In spite of these
low prices, the total amount of the sale was £1600,
the expenses of the sale&mdash;4s. in the pound = £320&mdash;being
deducted.</p>

<p>The catalogue was charged 2s. 6d.</p>

<p>The last sale in the seventeenth century to be
recorded is that of John Lloyd, Bishop of St.
Davids, sold in 1699 by John Bullord at Tom’s
Coffee-House.</p>

<p>When auctions were first started conditions of
sale were formulated, and with the exception of a
little elaboration, they remain pretty much what
they were at first; but there were certain peculiarities
which are worthy of mention.</p>

<p>The catalogues were not at first divided into
day’s sales, but as many lots as possible were sold
in the time fixed for the sale. The hours were
usually from nine to twelve, and from two to six.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
Sometimes the sales only took place in the evening.
In 1681 we learn that an average sale of 544 lots in
a day was considered satisfactory. In the Conditions
of Sale printed in the Catalogue of Seaman’s
library we <span class="lock">read&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“That the Auction will begin the 31st of October at the
Deceased D<span class="super">r’s</span> house in Warwick Court in Warwick Lane
punctually at nine Of the Clock in the morning and two in
the afternoon, and this to continue daily until all the books
be sold.”</p></div>

<p>The early hour was found a disadvantage, and
books often sold for low prices at the beginning of
sales, so that Cooper was forced to make a rule that
the sale should not be commenced unless there were
twenty present. At this time biddings of a penny
were common.</p>

<p>Two great evils came to light on the first institution
of auctions; one was due to the buyers, and
the other to the auctioneers. It was found that
in cases where the buyer thought he had given
more for a book than was wise, he often forgot to
pay and fetch away the books. Millington refers
specially to this in <span class="lock">1681&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I question not but the well disposed, and the Learned
will give us such incouragement in the Sale by Bidding in
some measure to the value of the Books so exposed, as
may further incourage and keep on foot such a commendable
and serviceable a way of sale (as this of Auction is)
to the great purposes of promoting Learning and Knowledge.
Which, when I consider, I cannot but wonder that
so many persons have appeared at our auctions, and buy
with a great freedom to the injury of others (that are truly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
conscientious to pay for, and fetch away the Books so
bought); yet in most auctions have hitherto neglected to
fetch away and pay for their own. To the end therefore
that they may know, we will not be damaged after so great
expences, as inevitably attends the management of an
auction; we do intend to prosecute them according to
the law if forthwith they do not send for their books, or
give us some reasonable satisfaction. To prevent any
abuses for the future that may happen to other gentlemen
who suffer by this unhandsome practice (of having Books
bought out of their hands by persons that never will, or
perhaps never designed to fetch them away), we shall, at
a convenient time, for the further satisfaction of gentlemen,
give an account of their names, and desire their absence
if any of them happen to be present.”<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></p>
</div>

<p>The other evil was the attempt of the booksellers
to get rid of some of their old stock by introducing
it into the sales of collectors’ libraries. This trick
has already been alluded to.</p>

<p>The frequenters of auctions seem to have been
very jealous of being bid against by any one interested
in the sale. This jealousy found voice in
the complaints of Wanley and others at Bridges’
sale in 1726.</p>

<p>The lots were not numbered throughout in the
catalogues, but the octavos, quartos, and folios
were each numbered separately, the number of
each section running on from the previous day’s
sale. This is very confusing, as when you look at
the end for the purpose of finding the total number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
of the lots, you only find the number of folios in
the sale. Millington found that it was not advisable
to bid for books, in case it might be supposed
that he was running them up in price, and Mr.
Pollard believes that he adopted a plan of getting
men to bid for him.</p>

<p>In corroboration of this view Mr. Pollard refers
to a copy of the catalogue of the libraries of Button,
Owen, and Hoel, 7th November 1681, in the British
Museum which belonged to Millington. It has
two receipts by persons whose names are among
the bidders for money received from Millington
for various books. “At first sight this seems a
reversal of what we should expect, but after the
first few sales the auctioneers had renounced the
right of making bids themselves, lest they should
be accused of running up prices, and Millington
had obviously employed these friends to bid for
him.”<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">45</a></p>

<p>Another evil connected with auctions comes from
<i>knocks out</i>, which are thoroughly dishonest, and in
fact, criminal, being, as they are, a form of conspiracy,
but the agreements of two persons not to bid against
one another are not necessarily to be condemned.
Mr. Henry Stevens was very urgent against any kind
of agreement, and in his reminiscences amusingly
describes his frustration of a knock-out; and it has
been said that when the Duke of Roxburghe and
Lord Spencer made an agreement, they were parties
to a knock-out; but this view is founded on a fallacy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
viz., that whatever price a book fetches at public
auction is the proper price. We know, however,
that this is not correct; for instance, the Valdarfer
<i>Boccaccio</i> fetched its huge price at the Roxburghe
sale because two great book-buyers with long
purses bid against one another. When one of
these buyers died and the book was again in the
market, seven years after the first sale, the survivor
obtained the book at a smaller price. Hence who
is to say whether £2260 or £918 is the actual value
of the book!</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI<br />

<span class="smaller">AUCTION SALES IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY</span></h2>


<p>The sales of the last quarter of the seventeenth century
are of the greatest interest in the history of the
subject, but they are not of any great value as guides
to present prices, for circumstances and tastes have
greatly changed. The sales were largely those of
the working libraries of theologians, and the books
which their owners found of use in their studies
sold well, while books in other classes which have
now taken their place in public esteem fetched
prices which seem to us very small. Among the
number of sales noticed in the last chapter, two
only stand out as the libraries of true collectors in
the modern acceptation of the term, that is, of those
who collect for love of the books rather than from
an appreciation of their utility. Much the same
conditions ruled during the first quarter of the
eighteenth century, although the library of Charles
Bernard, serjeant-surgeon to Queen Anne and
brother of Dr. Francis Bernard, previously referred
to, was sold in March 1711 at the Black Boy Coffee-House
in Ave Maria Lane, and the sale of the vast
collection of Thomas Rawlinson commenced in
1721. Then followed the sale of John Bridges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>’
library in February 1726, but the middle of the
century was passed when the great sale of Dr.
Richard Mead occurred. This (1754-55), when
compared with Askew’s sale in 1775, may be said
to mark an era in bibliography. These two great
physicians were friends with similar tastes. We are,
therefore, able to gauge the considerable growth of
the taste for book-collecting during the few years
that parted these two sales. Askew bought many
books at Mead’s sale, and when the same volumes
came to be sold at his own sale they realised twice
and thrice the prices he had given. We shall see
in the register of the sales after Askew’s day how
the prices gradually advanced, until we arrive at
the culmination of the bibliomaniacal spirit in the
Roxburghe sale of 1812.</p>

<p>We will now enumerate some of the principal
sales which took place during the eighteenth century,
which led up to the long list of sales which
have formed so marked a feature of the nineteenth
century.</p>

<p>Charles Bernard’s library, sold in 1711, was said
by Oldys to contain “the fairest and best editions
of the classics.” Swift, in his “Journal to Stella”
(19th March) wrote, “I went to-day to see poor
Charles Bernard’s books, and I itch to lay out nine or
ten pounds for some fine editions of fine authors”;
and on the 29th he adds, “I walked to-day into the
city and went to see the auction of poor Charles
Bernard’s books. They were in the middle of the
Physic books, so I bought none; and they are so
dear, I believe I shall buy none.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>The sale of the library of Thomas Britton, the well-known
small-coal man of Clerkenwell, in January
1715, deserves mention on account of the worthiness
of its owner. The books were sold by auction
at St. Paul’s Coffee-House by Thomas Ballard, and
the sale catalogue consists of forty closely-printed
pages in quarto. There were 664 lots in octavo,
274 in quarto, and 102 in folio, besides 50 pamphlets
and 23 manuscripts. This was the second library
Britton had collected, for some years before his
death he sold the first one by auction.</p>

<p>Thomas Rawlinson (1681-1725) was one of the
most insatiable of book collectors, and he left the
largest library that had been collected up to his
time. His chambers were so filled that his bed
had to be moved into a passage, and he took London
House, in Aldersgate Street, to accommodate
his ever-increasing library. Oldys says of <span class="lock">him&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If his purse had been much wider he had a passion
beyond it, and would have been driven to part with what
he was so fond of, such a pitch of curiosity or dotage he
was arrived at upon a different edition, a fairer copy, a
larger paper than twenty of the same sort he might be
already possessed of. In short, his covetousness after
those books he had not increased with the multiplication
of those he had, and as he lived so he died in his bundles,
piles, and bulwarks of paper, in dust and cobwebs, at London
House.”<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></p>
</div>

<p>He did, in fact, commence the sale of his library
before his death, and the first part was sold in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
December 1721. The catalogue of the whole library
occupied sixteen parts, the last being sold in 1734.
A complete set of these catalogues is very rare, and
the lists of them in the various bibliographical works
are mostly incomplete. There is, however, a set in
the Bodleian Library. The books in the first five
parts sold for £2409, and the manuscripts alone
took sixteen days of March 1734 to sell, and went
cheap. Hearne writes in his Diary (9th November
<span class="lock">1734)&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The MSS. in Dr. Rawlinson’s last auction of his
brother Thomas’s books went extraordinary cheap, and
those that bought had great penny worths. The Doctor
purchas’d many himself, at which here and there one were
disgusted, tho’ all the company supported the Doctor in
it, that as a creditor he had a right equal to any other.
My friend Mr. Tom Brome, that honest gentleman of
Ewithington in Herefordshire in a letter to the Doctor,
says that he cannot but wonder at the low rates of most
of the MSS., and adds ‘had I been in place I should have
been tempted to have laid out a pretty deal of money,
without thinking myself at all touched with bibliomania.’”<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">47</a></p>
</div>

<p>On 10th November Hearne further <span class="lock">writes&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Dr. Rawlinson by the sale of his brother’s books hath
not rais’d near the money expected. For it seems they
have ill answer’d, however good books; the MSS. worse,
and what the prints will do is as yet undetermin’d.”<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></p>
</div>

<p>It is worthy of mention here that Dr. Rawlinson
purchased Hearne’s Diaries for a hundred guineas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
from the widow and executrix of Dr. William
Bedford, to whom they had been given by Hearne,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">49</a>
and he bequeathed them with other property to the
University of Oxford. The auctioneers who dispersed
Thomas Rawlinson’s large collections were
Charles Davis and Thomas Ballard.</p>

<p>The sale of the valuable library of John Bridges
at his chambers in Lincoln’s Inn by Mr. Cock, in
February 1726, was an event of much literary
interest. The number of lots was 4313, occupying
twenty-seven days, and the total proceeds of the
sale were £4001. This is therefore worthy of note
as the first sale at which the prices averaged nearly
one pound per lot.</p>

<p>There was much dissatisfaction among the buyers
at the high prices, and a conspiracy to “bull” the
market was suspected.</p>

<p>Humphry Wanley expressed his opinion strongly
on this <span class="lock">point&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>Feb. 9, 1725-6.</i>&mdash;Went to Mr. Bridges’s chambers, but
could not see the three fine MSS. again, the Doctor his
brother having locked them up. He openly bid for his
own books, merely to enhance their price, and the auction
proves to be, what I thought it would become, very
knavish.”</p>

<p>“<i>Feb. 11, 1725-6.</i>&mdash;Yesterday at five I met Mr. Noel
and tarried long with him; we settled then the whole
affair touching his bidding for my Lord [Oxford] at the
roguish auction of Mr. Bridges’s books. The Reverend
Doctor one of the brothers hath already displayed himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
so remarkably as to be both hated and despised, and a
combination among the booksellers will soon be against
him and his brother-in-law, a lawyer. These are men of
the keenest avarice, and their very looks (according to
what I am told) dart out harping-irons. I have ordered
Mr. Noel to drop every article in my Lord’s commissions
when they shall be hoisted up to too high a price. Yet I
desired that my Lord may have the Russian Bible, which
I know full well to be a very rare and a very good book.”<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">50</a></p>
</div>

<p>The frontispiece to the sale catalogue exhibited
an oak felled, and persons bearing away the branches,
signifying that when the oak is cut down every man
gets wood. Nichols, referring to the motto, Δρυὸς πεσούσης πᾶς ἀνὴρ ξυλεύεται, speaks of it as “an
affecting memento to the collectors of great libraries,
who cannot or do not leave them to some public
accessible repository.”<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">51</a></p>

<p>Besides the sale catalogue, there was a <i>catalogue
raisonné</i> of Bridges’s library, a large paper of which,
bound in old blue morocco, and ruled with red
lines, Dr. Gosset bought for Dibdin for four shillings,
and the latter styles it a happy day when he
received it.</p>

<p>In 1731 was sold, at St. Paul’s Coffee-House, the
extensive library of Anthony Collins, the famous
freethinker and author, and a friend of Locke.
His books were sold in two divisions. Part 1 of
the catalogue contained 3451 lots, and part 2, 3442.</p>

<p>The sale of Dr. Thomas Pellet’s library in 1744 is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
of especial interest as the first undertaken by Samuel
Baker, the founder of the house of Sotheby.</p>

<p>In 1746 two sales of note took place, those of
Sir Christopher Wren and Michael Maittaire, the
scholar and bibliographer. The following advertisement
of the former is from the <i>Daily Advertiser</i>
of 26th October <span class="lock">1748&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“To be sold by auction, by Messrs. Cock and Langford,
in y<span class="super">e</span> Great Piazza, Covent Garden, this and y<span class="super">e</span> following
evening, the curious and entire libraries of y<span class="super">e</span> ingenious
architect Sir Christopher Wren, Knt., and Christopher
Wren, Esq., his son, late of Hampton Court; both deceased.
Consisting of great variety of Books of Architecture,
Antiquities, Histories, etc., in Greek, Latin, French,
and English; together with some few lots of Prints. The
said books may be viewed at Mr. Cock’s in y<span class="super">e</span> Great Piazza
aforesaid, till y<span class="super">e</span> time of sale, which will begin each evening
at 5 o’clock precisely. Catalogues of which may be had
gratis at y<span class="super">e</span> place of sale aforesaid.”</p>
</div>

<p>Maittaire’s library was sold in two parts, in
November 1748 and January 1749, by Mr. Cock,
and occupied forty-five evenings in the selling.
For some reason or other the books appear to
have been sacrificed, and they realised little more
than £700. One reason was, that they were not
very presentable in appearance. The auctioneer
writes in the “advertisement” to the <span class="lock">catalogue&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Tho’ the books in their present condition make not
the most ostentatious appearance, yet like the late worthy
possessor of them, however plain their outside may be,
they contain within an invaluable treasure of ingenuity and
learning. In fine, this is (after fifty years’ diligent search<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
and labour in collecting) the entire library of Mr. Maittaire,
whose judgement in the choice of books as it ever was confessed,
so are they undoubtedly far beyond whatever I can
attempt to say in their praise. In exhibiting them thus to
the public, I comply with the will of my deceased friend,
and in printing the catalogue from his own copy, just as he
left it (tho’ by so doing it is more voluminous), I had an
opportunity not only of doing the justice I owe to his
memory, but also of gratifying the curious.”</p></div>

<p>According to a very interesting account of the
sale in Beloe’s “Anecdotes” (vol. v. pp. 389-452),
it appears that if “the curious” attended the sale,
they did not do much to raise the prices. Beloe
writes, “The library of Michael Maittaire was of
incalculable value, from its great variety, from the
number of early printed books which it contained,
from the extraordinary collection of Greek and
Latin tracts by the famous French printers of the
sixteenth century, from the most uncommon books
in criticism which it exhibited, and lastly, from the
high reputation of its possessor.” And, in conclusion,
he says, “Such a collection was never before
exhibited for public sale, and perhaps never will
again.”</p>

<p>A striking instance of the absurdly low prices
obtained for the books is that of <i>Homeri Batrachomyomachia</i>
(Venet. per Leonicum Cretensem, 1486,
4to), which sold for sixteen shillings. In this copy
a subsequent possessor wrote the following <span class="lock">note&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This book is so extremely rare that I never saw any
other copy of it except that of Mons. de Boze, who told
me he gave 650 livres for it. Mr. Smith, our consul at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
Venice, wrote me word that he had purchased a copy, but
that it was imperfect. Lord Oxford offered Mr. Maittaire
fifty guineas for this identical copy.”</p></div>

<p>Askew’s copy, supposed to be the same as this,
fetched at his sale fourteen guineas.</p>

<p><i>Martialis, apud Vindelinum Spirensem&mdash;sine anno</i>&mdash;which
is described as “one of the rarest of rare
books,” only brought four shillings and sixpence.
The <i>editio princeps</i> of Plautus (<i>Venet. per Joh. de
Colonia et Vindelinum Spirensem</i>, 1472, folio) was
sold for sixteen shillings, while the Pinelli copy
fetched £36. These are no exceptions to the rule,
for Beloe mentions a large number of rare books
which only fetched a shilling or two shillings each.</p>

<p>The great library of Richard Mead, M.D., was
dispersed by Samuel Baker in November and
December 1754 and in April and May 1755. In the
first sale there were 3280 lots in 28 days, which
realised £2475, 18s. 6d. The second sale consisted
of 6741 lots in 29 days, realising £3033, 1s. 6d.,
making the totals for the two sales, 57 days, 10,021
lots, amount of sale £5509. It is usually stated
that Mead’s library consisted of 10,000 volumes,
but there must have been at least 30,000 volumes.
The numbering of lots in Mead’s sale followed the
confusing rule adopted at the first printing of auction
catalogues, viz., the leaving three separate
numberings of octavos, quartos, and folios. As
already said, this was the first really renowned
sale that took place in England, and there can
be little doubt that the owner spent considerably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
more money in the collection of his books than
they realised after his death. Johnson said of
Mead; that he lived more in the broad sunshine
of life than almost any man. The dispersion of
his library was a loss to the world, for every scholar
had been allowed access to it during the owner’s
life.</p>

<p>The novelist Fielding’s library was sold by Baker
in 1755. The sale consisted of 653 lots, occupied
four nights, and realised £364.</p>

<p>Richard Rawlinson, D.D., younger brother of
Thomas Rawlinson, died on the 6th of April 1755,
and his large and valuable library was sold by
Baker in March of the following year. The sale of
the books lasted fifty days, and there was a second
sale of pamphlets, books of prints, &amp;c., which
occupied ten days. The prices realised for old
English literature were very small, and the total
of the whole sale was under £1200.</p>

<p>The year 1756 was remarkable for the sale of the
library of Martin Folkes by Samuel Baker. It consisted
of 5126 lots, and realised £3091. Martin Folkes
occupied a prominent position in the literary and
scientific worlds as President of the Royal Society
and of the Society of Antiquaries. He was more a
generally accomplished man than a man of science,
and it has been the fashion to laugh at his pretensions
to the chair of the Royal Society, but his contemporaries
thought well of him. Dr. Jurin, secretary
of the Royal Society, said that “The greatest man
that ever lived (Sir Isaac Newton) singled him out
to fill the chair, and to preside in the Society when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
he himself was so frequently prevented by indisposition;
and that it was sufficient to say of him
that he was Sir Isaac’s friend.”</p>

<p>Edwards, the ornithologist, said of <span class="lock">Folkes&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“He seemed to have attained to universal knowledge,
for in the many opportunities I have had of being in his
company, almost every part of science has happened to be
the subject of discourse, all of which he handled as an
adept. He was a man of great politeness in his manners,
free from all pedantry and pride, and in every respect the
real, unaffected, fine gentleman.”</p></div>

<p>The earliest sale recorded of Samuel Paterson
was that of the library of “Orator” Henley, which
took place in June 1769, and contained some
curious books.</p>

<p>Joseph Smith, British Consul at Venice, was a
cultivated book collector. He printed a catalogue
of his library in 1755, <i>Bibliotheca Smitheana, seu
Catalogus Librorum D. Josephi Smithii, Angli ...
Venetiis, typis Jo. Baptistæ Pasquali</i>, <span class="smaller">MDCCLV</span>. This
is of value as containing an appendix to “the
prefaces and epistles prefixed to those works in the
library which were printed in the fifteenth century.”
George III. bought the whole library, and added it
to his own matchless collection. On the sale of his
library Consul Smith set to work to collect another,
and in 1773, a year after his death, this second library
was sold by auction by Baker &amp; Leigh, occupying
thirteen days in the selling. The books were described
as being “in the finest preservation, and
consisting of the very best and scarcest editions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
the Latin, Italian, and French authors, from the
Invention of Printing, with manuscripts and missals
upon vellum, finely illuminated.” The last day’s
sale contained all the English books in black letter.
This fine library realised £2245, not so large an
amount as might have been expected. In fact,
Dibdin says in his <i>Bibliomania</i> that Mr. Cuthell
exclaimed in his hearing that “they were given
away.”</p>

<p>In this same year, 1773, was sold the splendid
library of James West, President of the Royal
Society, the catalogue of which was digested by
Samuel Paterson. The preface informs the reader
that “the following catalogue exhibits a very curious
and uncommon collection of printed books and
travels, of British history and antiquities, and of
rare old English literature, the most copious of any
which has appeared for several years past; formed
with great taste and a thorough knowledge of
authors and characters.” There were 4633 lots,
and they occupied twenty-four days in the selling,
the auctioneer being Langford. West’s large
collection of manuscripts was sold to the Earl of
Shelburne, and is now in the British Museum.</p>

<p>Although this sale attracted much attention, and
was well attended, the prices did not rule high
according to our present ideas, but doubtless it
was not thought then that the following Caxtons
realised less than their value: Chaucer’s Works, first
edition by Caxton, £47, 15s. 6d.; “Troylus and
Cresseyde,” £10, 10s.; “Book of Fame,” £4, 5s.;
“Gower de Confessione Amantis,” 1483, £9, 9s.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>Dibdin has given a very full analysis of this fine
library in his <i>Bibliomania</i>. In contrast to this sale
may be mentioned, on account of the distinction of
the owner, the library of Oliver Goldsmith, which
was sold on 12th July 1774 by Mr. Good of Fleet
Street. There were 162 lots, and Mr. Forster has
reprinted the catalogue in his “Life of Goldsmith”
(vol ii. p. 453).</p>

<p>A very curious library was sold in this same year
(1774) by Paterson. The title of the catalogue
describes it as <span class="lock">follows&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A Catalogue of rare books and tracts in various
languages and faculties, including the Ancient Conventual
Library of Missenden Abbey in Buckinghamshire, together
with some choice remains of that of the late eminent
Sergeant at Law, William Fletewode, Esq., Recorder of
London in the reign of Queen Elizabeth; among which are
several specimens of the earliest typography, foreign and
English, including Caxton, Wynkyn de Worde, Pynson,
and others; a fine collection of English history, some
scarce old law books, a great number of old English plays,
several choice MSS. upon vellum, and other subjects of
literary curiosity....”</p></div>

<p>It will be seen from this that works of our early
printers were beginning to come into vogue, but
they did not fetch very high prices, varying from
five pounds to eight guineas. Two copies of the
first edition of Bacon’s “Essays,” 1597, went for
sixpence.</p>

<p>In 1775 one of the finest sales of the century took
place at the auction rooms of Baker &amp; Leigh,
that of Anthony Askew, M.D. (1722-1772), whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
ambition it was to have every edition of a Greek
author. His library largely consisted of classics,
and most of the books were in good condition.
There were 3570 lots sold in twenty-two days,
which realised £3993, or about £1 per lot. Mead’s
library consisted of 10,021 lots, which realised £5509,
or a little over half the average amount per lot
obtained at Askew’s sale. As the character of
Mead’s and Askew’s libraries was somewhat similar,
the difference may be partly accounted for by the
increased price of good books in the interval between
the two sales.</p>

<p>Mr. Christie sold in March 1776 the valuable
library of a very remarkable book-collector, John
Ratcliffe, who kept a chandler’s shop in the Borough.
It is said that he bought some of his treasures by
weight in the way of his business. His skill as a
collector was recognised by his brother collectors,
and on Thursday mornings he was in the habit of
giving breakfasts at his house in East Lane, Rotherhithe,
and to them Askew, Croft, Topham Beauclerk,
James West, and others, were constant visitors. At
these breakfasts he displayed his latest purchases.
He was a very corpulent man, and a few years
before his death, when a fire happened in his
neighbourhood, and his furniture and books were
removed for safety, he was unable to help those who
were engaged in the task. He stood lamenting the
loss of his Caxtons, when a sailor, who heard him,
attempted to console him, and cried, “Bless you, sir,
I have got them perfectly safe.” While Ratcliffe
was expressing his thanks, the sailor produced two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
of his fine curled periwigs which he had saved. He
had no idea that a man could make such a fuss over
a few books.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">52</a></p>

<p>There were nine days’ sale of 1675 lots. The
Caxtons numbered thirty, and realised an average
of £9 each.</p>

<p>Topham Beauclerk, the fashionable friend of Dr.
Johnson, collected a very large library, which was
distributed by Paterson in 1781. There were thirty
thousand volumes, which took fifty days to sell.
The library was rich in English plays, English
history, travels, and antiquities, but there were not
many high-priced books.</p>

<p>The sale of the library of the Rev. Thomas Crofts
in 1783, also by Paterson, was a much more important
event. It consisted of 8360 lots, distributed
over forty-three days, and realised £3453. We are
told in the preface to the sale catalogue <span class="lock">that&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The great reputation which the late Rev. and learned
Mr. Crofts had acquired, with respect to bibliographical
knowledge, cannot be better established than by the following
digest of his excellent library, in which no pains have
been spared to render it worthy the character of the collector,
and such as he himself, it is presumed, would not
have disapproved. The collection on the ‘Origin of
Letters,’and of Grammars and Dictionaries, is admirable,
and much fuller of curious books than is to be found in
many libraries of the first description. The theological
divisions comprehend many curious and valuable articles.... The
classical part of the library is indeed a treasure of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
Greek and Roman learning, comprising many of the early
editions, almost all the Aldine editions, and those of the
best modern commentators.”</p></div>

<p>Other classes well represented in the library were
Italian poetry, novels and plays, Spanish and Portuguese
poetry, &amp;c., history, topography, antiquities,
and voyages and travels. There is a portrait of
Mr. Crofts in Clarke’s <i>Repertorium Bibliographicum</i>.</p>

<p>In this same year, 1783, was sold by Mr. Compton
the elegant and curious library of an eminent collector
(Joseph Gulston), which contained a considerable
number of books printed on large paper,
and well bound. The library is described in the
catalogue as “undoubtedly the most select ever
offered to the public for beauty, scarcity, and
condition.” There were eleven days’ sale of 2007
lots, which realised £1750. In 1784 the remaining
portion of Mr. Gulston’s library was sold by the
same auctioneer. This consisted chiefly of a fine
collection of English typography, and the 784 lots
occupied four days in the selling.</p>

<p>Dr. Samuel Johnson’s library, which was sold in
1785, was not a very valuable one. It consisted of
650 lots, which sold for £100. Among them was
the second Shakespeare folio, now in the possession
of Sir Henry Irving.</p>

<p>In 1785 Dr. Askew’s collection of manuscripts
were sold, ten years after the printed books, when
they realised £1827. When Askew died in 1774
they were offered to a collector for two thousand
guineas, but the price was considered too large.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>The library of Major Thomas Pearson (1740-1781)
was sold by T. &amp; J. Egerton in 1788. The
sale extended over twenty-three days, and consisted
of 5525 lots. This library was very rich in old
English literature, and contained two volumes of
original ballads, which were bought by the Duke
of Roxburghe for £36, 4s. 6d., and with the Duke’s
additions are now safely preserved in the British
Museum.</p>

<p>The famous Pinelli library, founded by John
Vincent Pinelli in the sixteenth century, and augmented
by his descendants (the last possessor was
Maffeo Pinelli, a learned printer at Venice, who
died in 1785), was bought in 1788 by Messrs. Robson
&amp; Edwards, booksellers, for about £7000; and
on being brought to London was sold by auction
in Conduit Street in two divisions&mdash;the first, in
March and April 1789, consisted of sixty days’ sale,
and the second, in February and March 1790, of
thirty-one days. The total number of lots was
14,778, and they realised £9356, which did not
allow much profit to the purchasers after payment
of duties, carriage, and costs of the sale. The
library was very rich in Greek and Latin classics,
and Italian literature generally. The chief lot was
the <i>Complutensian Polyglot</i> (6 vols. folio, 1514-17),
printed on vellum, which fetched £483.</p>

<p>The sale of the choice library of M. Paris de
Meyzieux (Bibliotheca Parisina), which took place
in March 1791, is worthy of special record in that
the prices realised averaged considerably more than
in any previous sale, and has seldom been equalled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
even in our own day. The title of the English
catalogue is as <span class="lock">follows&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A Catalogue of a Collection of Books formed by a
Gentleman in France, not less conspicuous for his taste
in distinguishing than his zeal in acquiring whatever of this
kind was most perfect, curious, or scarce: it includes many
first editions of the classics: books magnificently printed
on vellum with illuminated paintings; manuscripts on vellum,
embellished with rich miniatures; books of natural
history, with the subjects coloured in the best manner or
with the original drawings and books of the greatest
splendour and rareness in the different classes of literature.
To these are added from another grand collection, selected
articles of high value. The whole are in the finest condition,
and in bindings superlatively rich.”</p></div>

<p>The library was bought from the executors of
Mons. Paris by M. Laurent of Paris and Mr. James
Edwards, and brought to London to be sold. There
were six days’ sale, and the 636 lots realised
£7095, 17s. 9d., or a little over eleven pounds per
lot. One of the most beautiful books in the sale
was the <i>Opere</i> of Petrarch, 1514, printed on vellum,
with charming miniatures attributed to Giulio Clovio.
Six of these were the Triumphs of Love, Chastity,
Death, Fame, Time, and the Deity. The borders
of the pages were ornamented with 174 exquisite
miniatures of birds, beasts, fishes, monsters, fabulous
histories, and various compositions of the
greatest ingenuity. This splendid folio volume
fetched £116, 11s. A similar book, but apparently
much less elaborate, a vellum Aristotle, recently
fetched £800 at the Ashburnham sale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>The library of Michael Lort, D.D., F.R.S., was
sold by Leigh &amp; Sotheby in this same year, 1791;
it contained a large number of interesting books,
particularly those on English history and antiquities,
many of which were enriched with MS. notes by
the Rev. George North. There were 6665 lots,
which occupied twenty-five days in the selling, but
the amount realised (£1269) was not large for so
considerable a collection.</p>

<p>In 1792 a great sale occurred at Dublin; it was of
the library of the Right Hon. Denis Daly, and was
dispersed under the hammer of James Vallance.
There is a good description of the library in the
<i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i> (1792, Part I., pp. 326-28),
but although Dibdin gives in his <i>Bibliomania</i> a
notice of some of the books, he does not record the
prices of several of the most interesting items mentioned
in the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i>. The number
of lots was 1441, which realised £3700. The library
was purchased entire from the executors of Mr.
Daly by John Archer and William Jones, two
Dublin booksellers, and the former told Dibdin
that Lord Clare offered £4000 for it before the
auction sale, but this offer was refused.</p>

<p>The Earl of Bute’s botanical library was sold by
Leigh &amp; Sotheby in 1794 for £3470. It was a ten
days’ sale.</p>

<p>The first part of Thomas Allen’s library was dispersed
in June 1795, and the second part in 1799,
both parts coming under the hammer of Leigh and
Sotheby. There were in all 3460 lots sold during
nineteen days, which realised £5737.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>The sale of the library of George Mason commenced
in January 1798, and continued till 1807,
when the fifth part was sold. The first part contained
497 lots (three days), which realised £620;
the second part 480 lots (three days), £784; the
third part 547 lots (three days), £670; the fourth
part, sold in 1799, 338 lots (two days), £586. All
were sold by Leigh &amp; Sotheby. The four parts
contained 1862 lots, and the total amount of the
sale was £2663. The fifth part, sold in 1807, contained
few lots of any importance.</p>

<p>The library of Richard Farmer, D.D., sold by
Mr. King in May 1798, was a peculiarly interesting
one, as containing a rich collection of early English
poetry, of which he was one of the earliest purchasers.
Although he employed agents to purchase
for him, he was not very liberal, and is said to have
made a rule not to exceed three shillings for any
book. The number of lots in the sale was 8199,
and thirty-six days were occupied in selling them.
The total amount of the sale was £2210, and the
library is supposed to have cost Dr. Farmer in
collecting about £500.</p>

<p>Dr. Farmer (1735-1797), author of the famous
“Essay on the Learning of Shakspeare,” and for
two-and-twenty years Master of Emanuel College,
Cambridge, was a curious character, who was said
to have loved three things&mdash;old port, old clothes,
and old books. It was further said that there were
three things which nobody could persuade him to
do, viz., to rise in the morning, to go to bed at
night, and to settle an account. He is said to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
imbibed his passion for collecting books from Dr.
Askew. Dr. Parr, who composed his Latin epitaph,
wrote of <span class="lock">him&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“How shall I talk of thee, and of thy wonderful collection,
O rare Richard Farmer?&mdash;of thy scholarship, acuteness,
pleasantry, singularities, varied learning, and colloquial
powers! Thy name will live long among scholars in general,
and in the bosoms of virtuous and learned bibliomaniacs
thy memory shall ever be enshrined! The walls of Emanuel
College now cease to convey the sounds of thy festive
wit; thy volumes are no longer seen, like Richard Smith’s
‘bundles of stitcht books,’ strewn upon the floor; and thou
has ceased in the cause of thy beloved Shakespeare to delve
into the fruitful ore of black letter literature. Peace to thy
honest spirit; for thou wert wise without vanity, learned
without pedantry, and joyous without vulgarity.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. Farmer at one time proposed to have had a
catalogue taken of his library, to which he intended
to have prefixed the following <span class="lock">advertisement&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This Collection of Books is by no means to be considered
as an essay towards a perfect Library; the circumstances
and the situation of the Collector made such an
attempt both unnecessary and impracticable. Here are
few publications of great price which were already to be
found in the excellent Library of Emanuel College; but
it is believed that not many private collections contain a
greater number of really curious and scarce books; and
perhaps no one is so rich in the antient philological
English literature.&mdash;<span class="smcap">R. Farmer.</span>”</p>

<span class="smaller">AUCTION SALES IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY</span></h2>


<p>The sales of the nineteenth century are so numerous,
that they must be treated in a more summary
manner than those of the two previous centuries.
The Roxburghe sale in 1812 marks an era in
bibliography, and after it a series of valuable sales
occurred until about the middle of the century,
when there was a certain period of dulness, although
great sales like those of the libraries of the Duke of
Sussex and the Duke of Buckingham (Stowe) took
place. In 1864 the fine library of George Daniel
was dispersed, when many editions of Shakespeare’s
plays, and much valuable dramatic literature, were
sold at high prices. In 1873 was the great sale of
Henry Perkins’s library, in 1881-83 the Sunderland
sale, and in 1882-84 the Beckford and Hamilton
sales. These three sales deserve an historian, such
as the Roxburghe sale had in Dibdin; but although
they created a great sensation, they have not been
written about as the Roxburghe sale was. The
effect of the high prices realised at these sales has
been to cause a great number of fine libraries to be
brought to the hammer. The century opened with
the sale by Mr. King of the valuable library of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
George Steevens, the Shakespearian commentator,
which commenced on 13th May 1800, and continued
during the ten following days. There were
1943 lots, which realised £2740. Useful lists of
some of the most interesting books in the sale are
given in Dibdin’s <i>Bibliomania</i> and Clarke’s <i>Repertorium
Bibliographicum</i>. The whole of the library
was sold, with the exception of an illustrated copy
of Shakespeare, bequeathed to Earl Spencer, the
corrected copy of Steevens’s edition of Shakespeare
to Mr. Reed, and a fine set of Hogarth’s
prints, in three volumes, to the Right Hon. William
Windham.</p>

<p>The sale of the library of Greffier Fagel of the
Hague was announced for sale in 1802, but instead
of coming to auction it was sold entire to Trinity
College, Dublin, for £7000. A catalogue, digested
by Samuel Paterson, in two parts, was printed in
1806.</p>

<p>The very valuable library of Robert Heathcote
was sold by Leigh, Sotheby &amp; Son in 1802 and
1808. The first sale, on 8th April 1802 and five
following days, was described as “an elegant collection
of books, comprising a very extraordinary
assemblage of the Greek and Roman classics, and
other books in the English, French, and Italian languages;
the greater part upon large paper, and
the whole in fine condition, in morocco and other
splendid bindings.” The number of lots was 958,
which realised £3361.</p>

<p>The second part was described as “a portion of
the singularly elegant library, late the property of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
very distinguished amateur [R. H.], likewise a few
duplicates belonging to the present possessor [John
Dent].... The books are almost universally bound
in different coloured morocco, by Roger Payne and
other eminent binders.” This sale took place on
4th April 1808 and five following days, and consisted
of 858 lots, which fetched £2469.</p>

<p>The third sale took place on 2nd May 1808 and
following day, when 222 lots were sold for £1246.
The books are described as bound by “the most
eminent English and French binders.” The totals of
the three sales were 2038 lots, which realised £7076.</p>

<p>The sale of the library of John Woodhouse, which
was carried out by Leigh, Sotheby &amp; Son, on 12th
December 1803 and four following days, was one
of great interest. The books were in fine condition,
and besides works on English history, topography,
&amp;c., there was a good collection of old English
poetry and romances. There were 862 lots, and
the amount realised was £3135.</p>

<p>James Edwards, who commenced bookselling in
Pall Mall about the year 1784, was in 1788 the joint
purchaser with James Robson, bookseller, of New
Bond Street, of the Pinelli library. He retired to
the Manor House, Harrow, some years before his
death, and gathered around him a very choice collection
of books. He is mentioned in the index
to Nichols’s “Literary Anecdotes” (1813) as the
possessor, “with numberless other literary treasures,”
of the famous Bedford Missal. On 25th April 1804
and three following days Mr. Christie sold a selection
from his library, which was described as “a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
most splendid and valuable collection of books,
superb missals, original drawings, &amp;c., the genuine
property of a gentleman of distinguished taste, retiring
into the country.” There were only 339 lots,
which fetched £4640, or nearly £14 per lot, a very
considerable average, but then the books were
highly distinguished. Dibdin gives, in part 5 of
his <i>Bibliomania</i>, a list of some of the more important
items, and in part 6 a notice of the large number of
books printed on vellum, in the collection. Dibdin
does not, however, mention that it belonged to
James Edwards.</p>

<p>On 5th April 1815 and five following days Mr.
Evans sold “the valuable library of James Edwards,
Esq., containing a splendid assemblage of early
printed books, chiefly on vellum, highly curious
and important manuscripts, magnificent books of
prints,” &amp;c. In this sale was the Bedford Missal,
which was bought by the Marquis of Blandford for
£687. There were 830 lots, which sold for £8421,
or rather more than £10 per lot. Edwards died
on 2nd January 1816, aged fifty-nine years.</p>

<p>The library of the first Marquis of Lansdowne
(previously Earl of Shelburne) was sold by
Leigh &amp; Sotheby in January and February 1806.
The sale occupied thirty-one days, and contained
6530 lots, which realised £6701. Amongst the
books was a very rare collection of tracts, documents,
and pamphlets relating to the French
Revolution, in more than 280 volumes, which sold
for £168. In 1807 the Marquis’s collection of
manuscripts were catalogued for sale, but they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
never came to auction, as they were purchased by
Parliament for the British Museum for £6000.</p>

<p>The Rev. Jonathan Boucher (1738-1804) possessed
a large library, which was sold by Leigh &amp;
Sotheby in three parts for a total of £4510. Part 1,
24th February 1806 and twenty-six following days,
6646 lots sold for £2990. Part 2, 14th April 1806
and eight following days, 1940 lots sold for £815.
Part 3, 29th May 1809 and three following days,
857 lots sold for £704. The library was full of
valuable and useful books in divinity, history,
voyages and travels, poetry, classics, &amp;c., but there
were few books of extreme rarity. Dibdin says in
his <span class="lock"><i>Bibliomania</i>&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I attended many days during this sale, but such was
the warm fire, directed especially towards divinity, kept up
during nearly the whole of it, that it required a heavier weight
of metal than I was able to bring into the field of battle to
ensure any success in the contest.”</p></div>

<p>The extensive library of the Rev. John Brand
was sold by Mr. Stewart in two parts. Part 1, in
May and June 1807, 8611 lots and MSS. 294 lots, in
thirty-seven days, sold for £4300. Part 2, February
1808, 4064 lots sold for £1851. The last lot in the
first part of the sale was Brand’s own work on
“Popular Antiquities,” with additions prepared for
republication, which, with copyright, sold for £630.
The books were in poor condition, and had been
mostly bought for small sums; in addition, no
money was expended by the proprietor on the
binding of his books.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>On the twenty-fourth day’s sale Dr. Gosset found
in one of the volumes of Menage’s French Dictionary
sixty-five pounds in bank-notes, and a rare
portrait of Margaret Smith, engraved by W. Marshall,
which was subsequently sold for twenty-seven
guineas. Previous to the removal of the library
from Somerset House, where Brand lived as secretary
of the Society of Antiquaries, Stewart, the
auctioneer, found by accident in an old waste-paper
volume seventy guineas wrapped up in paper and
placed in various parts of the book. The money
was handed to Mr. Brand’s executor.</p>

<p>Isaac Reed’s interesting library of old English
literature was sold by King &amp; Lochée in November
and December 1807. The sale occupied thirty-nine
days, and consisted of 8957 lots, which realised
£4386.</p>

<p>A five days’ sale of Lord Penrhyn’s library at
Leigh &amp; Sotheby’s in March 1809 brought £2000.</p>

<p>In June 1809 Leigh &amp; Sotheby sold the library of
Richard Porson, which consisted of 1931 lots, and
realised £1254. A list of the prices given for the
principal classics in this sale is printed in the
<i>Classical Journal</i> (i. 385-90).</p>

<p>The eminent antiquary Richard Gough bequeathed
his collection of British topography to
the Bodleian Library, but the rest of his library
was sold by Leigh &amp; Sotheby in April 1810 during
twenty days. There were 4373 lots, which sold
for £3552.</p>

<p>The Rev. Benjamin Heath, D.D., sold his very
fine library during his lifetime to Joseph Johnson,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
bookseller, of St. Paul’s Churchyard, who consigned
it to Mr. Jeffery in 1810 to be sold by auction.
The sale consisted of 4786 lots, and realised £8899.
Dibdin describes this sale in enthusiastic terms in
his <i>Bibliomania</i>. He <span class="lock">writes&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Never did the bibliomaniac’s eye alight upon ‘sweeter
copies,’ as the phrase is, and never did the bibliomaniacal
barometer rise higher than at this sale! The most marked
phrensy characterised it. A copy of the <i>editio princeps</i>
of Homer (by no means a first-rate one) brought £92,
and all the Aldine classics produced such an electricity of
sensation, that buyers stuck at nothing to embrace them!
Do not let it hence be said that black letter lore is the only
fashionable pursuit of the present age of book collectors.
This sale may be hailed as the omen of better and brighter
prospects in literature in general; and many a useful philological
work, although printed in the Latin or Italian language&mdash;and
which had been sleeping unmolested upon a
bookseller’s shelf these dozen years&mdash;will now start up
from its slumber, and walk abroad in a new atmosphere,
and be noticed and ‘made much of.’”</p></div>

<p>We now arrive at the year 1812, which will ever
be memorable in bibliographical annals on account
of the sale of the grand library of the Duke of
Roxburghe during forty-six days. The catalogue
was arranged by Messrs. G. &amp; W. Nicol, and in
the preface we <span class="lock">read&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“When literature was deprived of one of its warmest
admirers by the death of the Duke of Roxburghe, his
grace was in full pursuit of collecting our dramatic authors.
But when his collection of English plays is examined, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
the reader is informed that he had only turned his mind
to this class of literature for a few years, his indefatigable
industry will be readily admitted.”</p></div>

<p>Mr. Robert H. Evans, the bookseller of Pall
Mall, was induced to commence the business of
auctioneer with his sale, and he continued to sell
by auction for over thirty years.</p>

<p>The Roxburghe library consisted of 10,120 lots,
which sold for £23,397. Although one of the finest
libraries ever brought to the hammer, the glory
of the majority of the books was eclipsed by the
Valdarfer <i>Boccaccio</i>, 1471, which fetched £2260, the
largest sum ever paid for a book up to that time.
It has been said that the amount of the <i>Boccaccio</i>
day’s sale equalled what had been given by the
Duke for the entire collection.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">53</a></p>

<p>Leigh &amp; Sotheby sold in May 1812 the library of the
Marquis Townshend, during sixteen days, for £5745.</p>

<p>The splendid library of Colonel Stanley was sold
by Evans in April and May 1813, during eight days.
There were 1136 lots (or above 3000 volumes),
which sold for £8236. A unique copy of De Bry’s
Voyages, with duplicates of parts x. and xi. and a
large number of duplicate plates, bound in blue
morocco, sold for £546. Brunet wrote that at this
sale the thermometer of the bibliomania reached its
highest point.</p>

<p>The library of Stanesby Alchorne, of the Mint,
was bought entire by Earl Spencer, who sold at
Evans’s, in 1813, the portion which he did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
require, and added to the sale some of his own
duplicates. There were only 187 lots in this sale,
and they sold for £1769.</p>

<p>Leigh &amp; Sotheby sold the library of the Rev.
Isaac Gosset, a constant attendant on book-sales, in
1813 (the year after his death), during twenty-three
days. There were 5740 lots, which sold for £3141.
Gosset (the Lepidus of Dibdin) was much attached
to Richard Heber, whom he regarded as his pupil.</p>

<p>In this same year (1813) the famous Merly library
(Ralph Willett) was sold by Leigh &amp; Sotheby.
There were seventeen days, and 2906 lots, which
sold for £13,508. It was said at the time that if
ever there was a unique collection this was one.</p>

<p>A choice and small library of a well-known collector
(John Hunter) was sold in this same year by
Leigh &amp; Sotheby, in a three days’ sale, with 405 lots,
which realised £1344.</p>

<p>Messrs. King &amp; Lochée sold the library of John
Horne Tooke, 1813. There were four days, and
1813 lots, which fetched £1250.</p>

<p>In 1814 and 1815 the library of John Towneley
was sold by Evans. Part 1 in June 1814, seven
days, 904 lots, amount of sale £5890. Part 2, June
1815, ten days, 1703 lots, amount of sale £2707, or
a total for the two parts of £8597. The Towneley
Mysteries sold for £147. A small remaining portion
of the Towneley library was sold by Evans in 1817.</p>

<p>Mr. Towneley’s collection of drawings, prints,
books of prints, &amp;c., was sold by Mr. King in 1816
for £1414, and a collection of the works of Hollar,
also by Mr. King, in May 1818 for £2108.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1816 there were several fine sales. Evans sold
Edward Astle’s library, which occupied two days’
sale, and consisted of 265 lots, realising £2366; Dr.
Vincent’s, Dean of Westminster, library, in six days’
sale, 1176 lots, which sold for £1390; and the library
of Marshal Junot, which consisted chiefly of books
printed on vellum&mdash;the 139 lots sold for £1397; but
this fact by itself is misleading, insomuch that the
books of more than half that value were bought
in, viz., £779, making those sold amount only to
£618.</p>

<p>Messrs. Leigh &amp; Sotheby sold in 1816 the library
of Prince Talleyrand, which was described as <i>Bibliotheca
splendissima</i>. There were eighteen days’ sale,
and the amount realised was £8399.</p>

<p>In this same year (1816) Mr. J. G. Cochrane sold
the Gordonstoun library of Sir Robert Gordon.
It contained 2421 lots, occupying twelve days in the
selling, and realising £1539. This sale is specially
alluded to by Mr. Hill Burton in his “Book-Hunter”
as a remarkable exception to the rule that great
book-sales seldom “embrace ancestral libraries
accumulated in old houses from generation to
generation.” This library “was begun by Sir
Robert Gordon, a Morayshire laird of the time of
the great civil wars of the seventeenth century.
He was the author of the ‘History of the Earldom
of Sutherland,’ and a man of great political as
well as literary account. He laid by heaps of the
pamphlets, placards, and other documents of his
stormy period, and thus many a valuable morsel,
which had otherwise disappeared from the world,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
left a representative in the Gordonstoun collection.
It was increased by a later Sir Robert, who had the
reputation of being a wizard. He belonged to one
of those terrible clubs from which Satan is entitled
to take a victim annually; but when Gordon’s turn
came, he managed to get off with merely the loss of
his shadow.”</p>

<p>William Roscoe’s fine library was also sold in
1816 by Winstanley of Liverpool. There were 1918
lots, and fourteen days’ sale, the amount realised
being £5150.</p>

<p>It is worthy of mention that in 1817 Evans sold
the library of Count Borromeo of Padua, and that
the books were very fully described in the catalogue.
In one instance a book which only sold
for half-a-crown was described in fourteen lines.
The catalogue of 324 lots occupied seventy-seven
octavo pages. The total proceeds of the sale were
£726.</p>

<p>The cataloguing of the time was not affected by
this example, and it was many years before full
descriptions were given in sale catalogues. M.
Libri’s annotated catalogues of 1859-62 set the new
fashion.</p>

<p>The book sales from this date become so very
numerous, that it is impossible in the space at our
disposal to register more than a few of the most
important, and these must be recorded quite succinctly.</p>

<p>The sale of Edmond Malone’s library at Sotheby’s
in 1818 occupied eight days, and brought £1649.</p>

<p>The great sale by Evans of James Bindley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>’s
library, which was particularly rich in early English
literature, was spread over several years. Part 1,
December 1818, twelve days, 2250 lots, amount of
sale £3046. Part 2, January 1819, twelve days,
2588 lots, amount realised £4631. Part 3, February
1819, eleven days, 2321 lots [amount not given in
Evans’s sale catalogues in the British Museum.]
Part 4, August 1820, books, six days, 1132 lots,
amount £2253. [Part 5] omissions, January 1821,
five days, 1092 lots [no totals given].</p>

<p>Bindley’s portraits, prints and drawings, and
medals were sold by Sotheby in 1819. Part 1,
Bindley Granger. Part 2, portraits. Part 3, prints
and drawings. [Part 4], medals. These realised
£7692.</p>

<p>John North’s library was sold in 1819 by Evans
in three parts. Part 1, nine days, 1497 lots, £4285.
Part 2, twelve days, 2175 lots, £5679. Part 3, four
days, 842 lots, £2842. Total, £12,806.</p>

<p>Evans sold George Watson Taylor’s library in
1823. Part 1, six days, 965 lots, £3850. Part 2,
eight days, 1207 lots, £4926.</p>

<p>The great Fonthill Abbey sale (Beckford’s collection)
occurred in 1823. The sale occupied thirty-seven
days, of which twenty were taken up with
the disposal of the library of 20,000 volumes. The
auctioneer was Mr. Phillips of New Bond Street,
and the place of sale was the Abbey.</p>

<p>George Nassau’s library was sold by Evans in
1824. Part 1, twelve days, 2603 lots, £4894. Part
2, eight days, 1661 lots, £3611.</p>

<p>A still finer library than this was sold in the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
year by Evans, that of Sir Mark Masterman Sykes,
Bart. Part 1, eleven days, 1676 lots, £9505. Part 2,
six days, 825 lots, £4580. Part 3, eight days, 1190
lots, £4644, making a total of 3691 lots, which realised
£18,729.</p>

<p>Almost a rival to this was the sale by Evans in
1827 of the library of John Dent, F.R.S. Part 1,
nine days, 1502 lots, £6278. Part 2, nine days,
1474 lots, £8762. Totals, 2976 lots, and £15,040.</p>

<p>In 1827 the library of the Duke of York was sold
at Sotheby’s for £5718.</p>

<p>The Earl of Guilford’s library was sold by Evans
in seven parts in the years 1828, 1829, 1830, and
1835. There were forty days and 8511 lots, and
the total amount realised was £12,175. These totals
were made up as follows:&mdash;Part 1 (1828), nine days,
1788 lots, £1665. Part 2 (1829), six days, 1459 lots,
£1757. Part 3 (1829), three days, 740 lots, £880.
Manuscript (1830), five days, 679 lots, £4441.
Library from Corfu: Part 1 (1830), five days, 1124
lots, £998. Part 2 (1831), four days, 722 lots, £678.
Remaining portion (1835), eight days, 1999 lots,
£1756.</p>

<p>The great sale of George Hibbert’s library by
Evans was commenced in 1829, forty-two days’
sale, 8794 lots, £6816.</p>

<p>Evans sold in 1831 the small but fine library of
the Duchesse de Berri, who is described on the
catalogue as an “Illustrious Foreign Personage.”
There were five days, and 846 lots, which realised
£5160.</p>

<p>In 1832 Evans sold the library of Philip Hurd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
for £5545. There were 1464 lots, which occupied
eight days in selling.</p>

<p>In this same year the choicer portion of John
Broadley’s library was sold, also by Evans. There
were 589 lots in three days’ sale, which realised
£2052. The second portion was sold during six
days in 1833, 1225 lots, which realised £3707.</p>

<p>Joseph Haslewood’s library was sold by Evans
in 1833. This was an eight days’ sale, consisting
of 1855 lots; which realised £2471. The amount
was probably more than the late proprietor expected,
as he said he would refuse a thousand pound cheque
in exchange for his books. Dibdin remarks in his
“Reminiscences” on the fact that Haslewood always
intended that his books should be sold by Sotheby.
He was in the habit of saying, “What will Sam
Sotheby make of this or that after I am gone?”</p>

<p>In 1833 and 1834 the library of P. A. Hanrott
was sold by Evans in five parts, and during forty-seven
days, for £22,409. There were 10,826 lots.
These totals are obtained as follows:&mdash;Part 1 (1833),
twelve days, 2504 lots, £7487. Part 2 (1833), twelve
days, 2574 lots, £5161. Part 3 (1834), twelve days,
2753 lots, £5727. Part 4 (1834), six days, 1489 lots,
£2845. Part 5 (1834), five days, 1506 lots, £1189.</p>

<p>The great sale of the library of Richard Heber
took place during the years 1834, 1835, and 1836.
Mr. H. Foss has written the following totals for the
twelve parts in a copy of the catalogue in the British
Museum. Two hundred and two days of sale, 52,676
lots, 119,613 volumes, which sold for £56,774. The
proportionate total cost to Mr. Heber of the library<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
is put at £77,750. The following are the particulars
of the various parts:&mdash;Part 1, April and May 1834,
sold by Sotheby &amp; Son, twenty-six days, 7486 lots,
£5615. Part 2, June and July (Sotheby), twenty-five
days, 6590 lots, £5958. Part 3, November
(Sotheby), seventeen days, 5055 lots, £2116. Part
4, December, sold by R. H. Evans, fifteen days,
3067 lots, £7248. Part 5, January and February
1835, sold by B. Wheatley, twenty days, 5693 lots,
£2623. Part 6, March and April (Evans), twenty
days, 4666 lots, £6771. Part 7, May and June
(Evans), twenty-one days, 6797 lots, £4035. Part
8, February and March 1836 (Evans), twelve days,
3170 lots, £3955. Part 9, April (Sotheby), fourteen
days, 3218 lots, £6463. Part 10, May and June
(Sotheby), fourteen days, 3490 lots, £2117. Part 11,
manuscripts (Evans), ten days, 1717 lots, £8964.
Part 12, July (Wheatley), eight days, 1727 lots,
£894. Part 13 (and last) was sold in February
1837 by Wheatley, six days, 1558 lots, £780. This
amount must be added to the totals of the twelve
parts given above.</p>

<p>In 1835 the remarkable collection of Dr. Kloss
of Frankfort was sold by Sotheby &amp; Son. It contained
many original and unpublished manuscripts
and printed books, with MS. annotations attributed
to Philip Melancthon. There were 4682 lots, which
took twenty days to sell, and realised £2261. The
catalogue was the work of Samuel Leigh Sotheby,
and he expended much labour upon it.</p>

<p>Evans sold in 1835 the fine library of the Comte
de Noailles, who is described in the catalogue as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
“a distinguished collector.” There were 952 lots,
sold in five days for £3188.</p>

<p>The Hon. Baron (Sir William) Bolland’s library
was sold by Evans in 1840. The sale consisted of
2940 lots, and occupied thirteen days, realising
£3019. In the next year was sold, also by Evans,
the library of Thomas Hill (supposed to be the
original of Paul Pry), during seven days. There
were 1684 lots, which brought £1424.</p>

<p>The library of George Chalmers, F.R.S., was sold
by Evans in 1841 and 1842, and the catalogue was
divided into three parts. Part 1, September and
October 1841, nine days, 2292 lots, £2190. Part 2,
March 1842, six days, 1514 lots, £1918. Part 3,
November 1842, eight days, 1966 lots, £2081.</p>

<p>Horace Walpole’s collections were sold at Strawberry
Hill by George Robins in April and May
1842, during twenty-four days. The first six days
were devoted to the sale of the library, which
consisted of 1555 lots, and realised £3900. It
was very badly catalogued, and the books and
books of prints, collection of portraits, &amp;c., forming
the seventh and eighth days’ sale, were withdrawn,
re-catalogued, and extended to a ten days’
sale.</p>

<p>The library of Lord Berwick was sold at Sotheby’s
in April and May 1843 for £6726.</p>

<p>The great sale of the years 1844 and 1845, at
Evans’s, was that of the extensive library of the
Duke of Sussex, which occupied sixty-one days in
selling, and consisted of 14,107 lots. The total
amount realised was £19,148. The sale was divided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
into six parts, as follows:&mdash;Part 1, July 1844,
theology, twenty-four days, 5551 lots, £8438. Part
2, July and August 1844, manuscripts, four days,
510 lots, £3126. Part 3, August 1844, history, topography,
voyages and travels, six days, 1523 lots,
£2096. Part 4, January and February 1845, Greek
classics, foreign history, &amp;c., eleven days, 2641 lots,
£2121. Part 5, April and May 1845, poetry, drama,
polygraphy, Latin classics, belles-lettres, &amp;c., twelve
days, 2956 lots, £2649. Part 6, August 1845, four
days, 926 lots, £718.</p>

<p>The library of Mr. B. H. Bright was sold at
Sotheby’s in three divisions in 1845, and the total
amount realised was £8997.</p>

<p>In 1849 Messrs. Southgate &amp; Barrett tried the
experiment of selling the library of the Rev. H. F.
Lyte and J. W. M. Lyte in the evening, but the
new departure (or rather, revival of an old practice)
did not meet with approval, and the practice was
not followed. There were 4368 lots, and the sale
occupied seventeen evenings.</p>

<p>In this same year the world was startled by the
dispersion of the Duke of Buckingham’s property at
Stowe House, and Messrs. Sotheby sold the library
during twenty-four days. There were 6211 lots, and
the total amount realised for library and prints was
£14,155. The Stowe MSS. were sold by private
contract to the Earl of Ashburnham for £8000.</p>

<p>Since this time the sale of great libraries from the
old family mansions have been so numerous, that
little surprise is felt when another is added to the
long list.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>Messrs. Sotheby sold in 1851 the library of
Granville Penn, during six days, for £7845; in 1851
the library of E. V. Utterson, during eight days, for
£5494; in 1853 the library of Dawson Turner for
£4562, and that of Baron Taylor for £4087; in
1854 the private library of William Pickering for
£10,700; in 1857 the library of the Earl of Shrewsbury
for £3250.</p>

<p>Between 1859 and 1864 were sold at Sotheby’s the
various portions of the library of Mons. Gulielmo
Libri. The 1176 lots of manuscripts were sold in
eight days of March and April 1859, and realised
£6783. The “choicer portion” of the library was
sold in August of the same year, thirteen days, 2824
lots, £8822.</p>

<p>In 1861 the mathematical and general library
was sold. Part 1, A to L, twelve days, 4335 lots,
£1349. Part 2, M to Z, eight days, lots 4336 to
7268, £877.</p>

<p>The “reserved portion” was sold in July 1862,
during four days. The number of lots was 713, and
these sold for the immense sum of £10,328, or an
average of over £14 per lot.</p>

<p>The library of Miss Richardson Currer was sold
at Sotheby’s in 1862, during ten days, for £5984.</p>

<p>In July 1864 was sold by Sotheby, Wilkinson, and
Hodge the extremely interesting library of George
Daniel, which was specially rich in old English
literature, and remarkable for the superb collection
of Shakespeare folios and quartos. The sale occupied
ten days, and realised £15,865.</p>

<p>At the same auction rooms were sold in 1865 the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
library of J. B. Nicholl, in two parts, for £6175; in
1867 the library of Sir Charles Price for £5858;
and in 1868 the library of Macready, the actor,
for £1216.</p>

<p>In 1868, 1869, 1870, 1871, and 1873 were sold at
Sotheby’s eight portions of the unique poetical
library of the Rev. T. Corser, which realised
£19,781.</p>

<p>The library, engravings, and autographs of John
Dillon were sold by the same firm in 1869, during
twelve days, for £8700.</p>

<p>The library of Lord Selsey was sold in 1872 for
£4757.</p>

<p>The sale in 1873 by Messrs. Gadsden, Ellis &amp; Co.,
at Hanworth Park, of the grand library of Henry
Perkins created a sensation. The late owner had
been a purchaser at the time of the bibliomaniacal
fever after the Roxburghe sale, and for years the
library was practically forgotten, so that the opportunity
afforded to book-collectors of purchasing its
choice rarities came as a surprise. The four days’
sale realised £25,954.</p>

<p>In 1874 the choice library of Sir William Tite was
sold at Sotheby’s, during sixteen days, for £19,943.</p>

<p>The same firm sold the library of the Rev. C. H.
Crauford, during five days, in July 1876 for £6229.</p>

<p>In 1878 Messrs. Sotheby sold the very choice
collection of books and miniatures formed by Mr.
J. T. Payne, of the firm of Payne &amp; Foss, which
realised £2843, or about £16 per lot, the day’s sale
consisting of only 117 lots.</p>

<p>In 1879, 1880, and 1881 the fine library of Dr. David<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Laing, of the Signet Library, Edinburgh, was sold
at Sotheby’s in four portions, which realised a total
of £16,536, the first part alone making £13,288.</p>

<p>A portion of the library of Cecil Dunn Gardner
was sold in June 1880 at Sotheby’s, during six days,
for £4734. The same firm sold in 1881 a portion
of the Earl of Clare’s library for £2130, a portion
of Lord Hampton’s library for £3539, and a portion
of the library of G. L. Way for £2324; Daniel
Gurney’s library, four days, £1687; library of a
collector (Mr. Gulston), £1173.</p>

<p>Never before has there been, and probably never
again will there be, two such remarkable sales as
those of the Sunderland and Beckford libraries at
the same time. The Sunderland library, the sale
of which was commenced by Messrs. Puttick and
Simpson in December 1881, was formed by Charles,
third Earl of Sunderland, who died on 19th April
1722, and was transferred from the Earl’s house
in Piccadilly in 1733, when Charles, fifth Earl of
Sunderland, became Duke of Marlborough. Successive
Dukes of Marlborough added a few books
to the library, but it is noteworthy, as we turn over
page after page of the catalogue, how seldom we
come upon a book published since 1722. On the
1st of December a large company was gathered in
the famous auction-room in Leicester Square, to
watch the progress of what promised to be one of
the most remarkable sales of modern times. Some
of those who formed this company were to become
duellists in the fight over the treasures arranged
upon the shelves round the room, for the fight for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
chief lots always resolved itself into a duel in the end.
Those who expected the books to make a distinguished
external appearance were disappointed, for
more than a century’s occupation of the great library
at Blenheim, with a scorching sun beating down upon
the backs of the books from the huge windows, had
destroyed a large proportion of the bindings. When
the sale opened it was seen that prices would rule
high; but at the same time, the character of the
library, which contained many books now hopelessly
out of fashion, was marked by the sudden
drop in the prices from hundreds of pounds to a
shilling or so, soon again to rise to hundreds of
pounds. Mr. Quaritch was the hero of the sale,
and after him the chief combatants were Mr. F. S.
Ellis and M. Techener, while Mr. Henry Stevens,
Mr. Pearson, Messrs. Pickering, Messrs. Morgand
and Fatout, and some others made a good fight for
the lots they required. As the bids of £10 and
upwards went on rapidly till £1000&mdash;in some cases
more&mdash;were reached, the excited faces of those
around formed a sight worth seeing, for few could
resist the excitement, which found vent in applause,
when the lot was knocked down.</p>

<p>Part 1, December 1881, realised £19,373. Part 2,
April 1882, £9376. Part 3, July, £7792. Part 4,
November, £10,129. Each of these parts consisted
of ten days’ sale. Part 5 (and last), March
1883, contained eleven days’ sale, and realised £9908.
The lots were numbered throughout the parts, and
amounted to 13,858. The total amount realised by
the sale was £56,581, 6s.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>When the sale was concluded Mr. Quaritch made
a short speech appropriate to the occasion, and said
that “This was the most wonderful library that had
been sold by auction in the present century. Fine
as the Hamilton library was he could form another
like it to-morrow, but nothing like the Sunderland
library would be seen again as a private collection.
He held its founder in the highest respect and
gratitude.”</p>

<p>On the 30th of June 1882 the sale of the beautiful
library of William Beckford was commenced at
Sotheby’s by Mr. Hodge. The books were in the
finest condition, and in consequence they fetched
very high prices. Mr. Henry Bohn, writing to
<i>The Times</i> at the commencement of this sale, said
that Beckford was the greatest book enthusiast he
ever knew. He was a great collector of “Aldines
and other early books bearing the insignia of celebrities,
such as Francis I., Henri et Diane, and De
Thou, and especially of choice old morocco bindings
by Deseuil, Pasdeloup, and Derome.” Mr.
Bohn further said that after Beckford’s death, and
while the books were still at Bath, the Duke of
Hamilton, Beckford’s son-in-law, wished to sell the
whole library. Mr. Bohn offered £30,000, payable
within a week; but although the Duke would willingly
have accepted the offer, the Duchess would
not agree to the sale of her father’s books. Mr.
Bohn estimated that the library was now worth
£50,000. It actually sold for £73,551. Part 1,
June and July 1882, consisted of twelve days’ sale
and 3197 lots, which realised £31,516. Part 2,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
December, twelve days, 2732 lots, £22,340. Part 3,
July 1883, twelve days, 2781 lots, £12,852. Part 4
(and last), November, four days, 1127 lots, £6843.
The total number of lots in the forty days’ sale was
9837.</p>

<p>The library collected by the Duke of Hamilton
(when Marquis of Douglas) at the same time as
Beckford was adding to his own, was sold by
Messrs. Sotheby, Wilkinson &amp; Hodge during eight
days of May 1884. There were 2136 lots, which
realised £12,892. The most valuable portion of
the Hamilton library was the collection of matchless
manuscripts, which were kept distinct from
the printed books, and sold to the German Government.</p>

<p>During the years that the Blenheim and Hamilton
Palace libraries were selling many valuable sales
took place, and since then there have been a great
number of fine libraries dispersed. We have only
space to mention shortly a few of these; but with
respect to the last ten years there is the less need
for a full list, in that a valuable record of sales is
given in the annual volumes of Slater’s “Book
Prices Current,” and Temple Scott’s “Book Sales.”</p>

<p>The important topographical library of James
Comerford was sold by Sotheby, Wilkinson, and
Hodge in 1881. There were 4318 lots, in thirteen
days’ sale, which realised £8327.</p>

<p>In 1882 the library of Frederic Ouvry, P.S.A.,
which consisted of 1628 lots, in a six days’ sale,
was sold at Sotheby’s for £6169; and the choice
library of a gentleman, £3366.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>In March 1882 was sold a portion of the Right
Hon. A. J. B. Beresford-Hope’s library (two days,
£2316), and further portions were sold in 1892.</p>

<p>The Stourhead heirlooms (Sir Richard Colt
Hoare) were sold at Sotheby’s in July 1883, eight
days, 1971 lots, £10,028.</p>

<p>The Towneley Hall library, consisting of 2815 lots,
in an eight days’ sale, realising £4616, and the
Towneley Hall manuscripts (two days, 235 lots,
£4054) were both sold in June 1883 at Sotheby’s,
as was also the Drake library (four days, £3276).</p>

<p>In 1884 were sold at Sotheby’s the library of
Francis Bedford, bookbinder (five days, 1551 lots),
for £4867, and the Syston Park library of Sir
John Hayford Thorold, Bart. (eight days, 2110 lots),
£28,001.</p>

<p>The Earl of Gosford’s library was sold by Puttick
and Simpson in 1884, eleven days, 3363 lots, £11,318.</p>

<p>It is curious to compare the sale of a library such
as Beckford’s with one like James Crossley. Both
were great collectors, and possessed many dainties;
but whilst the former was particular as to condition,
with the consequence that his books fetched high
prices, the latter was regardless of this, and necessarily
his sold for small sums.</p>

<p>One portion of Crossley’s library was sold at
Manchester by F. Thompson &amp; Son (seven days,
2682 lots), but other two parts were dispersed in
London by Sotheby, Wilkinson &amp; Hodge. Part 1
(1884), seven days, 2824 lots. Part 2 (1885), nine
days, 3119 lots, £4095.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>The fine library of the Earl of Jersey at Osterley
Park was sold by Sotheby’s in May 1885 for
£13,007; where also was sold, in the following
month, the library of the Rev. J. F. Russell for
£8682.</p>

<p>In 1885 the sale of the miscellaneous but valuable
library of Leonard Lawrie Hartley was commenced
by Messrs. Puttick &amp; Simpson. Part 1 (1885) consisted
of 2475 lots, occupying ten days in the selling,
which realised £9636. Part 2 (1886), ten days’ sale
of 2582 lots, £5258. Part 3 (1887), eight days’ sale
of 2937 lots, £1635.</p>

<p>In January 1886 was sold the library of Mr. Wodhull,
£11,972; and in November of the same year
Edward Solly’s, F.R.S., £1544.</p>

<p>A selection from the magnificent library of the
Earl of Crawford was sold at Sotheby’s in 1887
and 1889. Portion 1 (1887), ten days, 2146 lots,
realised £19,073. Portion 2 (1889), four days, 1105
lots, £9324.</p>

<p>Messrs. Sotheby, Wilkinson &amp; Hodge in 1887
and 1888 sold the almost equally fine library of
Mr. James T. Gibson-Craig. First portion (1887),
ten days, 2927 lots, realised £6803. Second portion
(1888), fifteen days, 5364 lots, £7907. Third portion
(1888), three days, £809. The total amount realised
for the three portions was £15,509.</p>

<p>A choice portion of Baron Seillière’s library was
sold in February 1887 (1440 lots, £14,944). A
second portion was afterwards sold in Paris.</p>

<p>In 1888 Messrs. Christie, Manson &amp; Woods sold
the library of the Earl of Aylesford (£10,574); and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
the Wimpole library, which formerly belonged to
Lord Chancellor Hardwicke (£3244).</p>

<p>In the same year the beautiful library of Mr. R.
S. Turner was sold at Sotheby’s. Part 1, June 1888,
twelve days, 2999 lots, £13,370. Part 2, November
1888, fourteen days, £2874. The total amount
realised for the whole library was £16,244.</p>

<p>Mr. Turner sold in Paris in 1878 a previous collection
of books in 774 lots, which realised the large
sum of 319,100 francs (£12,764).</p>

<p>In February 1889 were sold at Sotheby’s the Earl
of Hopetoun’s library of 1263 lots for £6117, and
that of R. D. Dyneley, £3084. At the same auction
rooms, and in the same year, were sold the library
of John Mansfield Mackenzie of Edinburgh, remarkable
for a large number of illustrated editions of
modern authors, 2168 lots, in an eight days’ sale,
£7072; and that of J. O. Halliwell Phillipps, four
days, 1291 lots, £2298.</p>

<p>Also at Sotheby’s in 1889 were sold the libraries
of Frederick Perkins (2086 lots, £8222); the Duke
of Buccleuch (selection), 1012 lots, £3705; W. D.
Salmond, £2557.</p>

<p>In the following year Thomas Gaisford’s library
was sold at Sotheby’s (eight days, 2218 lots, £9236);
also that of Frederick William Cosens (twelve days,
4995 lots, £5571); that of Sir Edward Sullivan
(choicer portion), £11,002; that of Frank Marshall
(six days, 1937 lots, £2187); that of Alexander
Young, £2238; and that of T. H. Southby,
£2241.</p>

<p>In 1891 were sold the libraries of Cornelius Paine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>

<p>It is worthy of notice in the above list that the
amounts realised for the Heber and Sunderland
sales were almost identical, while the totals of the
Hamilton Palace libraries were larger than those
for any other English sale, viz., £86,543 (Beckford,
£73,551; Duke of Hamilton, £12,892).</p>

<p>In these totals the sales of booksellers’ stocks
have not been recorded, because they do not sell
so well as private libraries, owing to a rather absurd
impression in the minds of buyers that the rarer
books would have sold out at the shops had they
been of special value; but it may be noted here
that the stock of Messrs. Payne &amp; Foss was sold in
three portions in 1850 for £8645 (certainly much
less than its worth) by Sotheby, who sold in
1868-70-72 Mr. Henry G. Bonn’s stock, in three
parts, for £13,333, and Mr. Lilly’s in 1871 and 1873,
in five parts, for £13,080. In 1873 Mr. T. H. Lacy’s
stock of theatrical portraits and books were sold at
Sotheby’s for £5157.</p>

<p>Mr. F. S. Ellis’s stock was sold in November 1885
for £15,996, and Mr. Toovey’s in February 1893 for
£7090. The latter’s sporting books realised £1031.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>It is very much the fashion now to average the
amounts realised at auctions, and to point out that
at such a sale the amount obtained was about £10
or more per lot. This is a useful generalisation so
far as it goes, but further information is required to
enable the reader to obtain a correct idea of value.
The generalisation is useful in regard to a mass
of sales; thus we may say broadly, that in the
last century the ordinary large and good libraries
averaged about £1 per lot, while in the present
century they average at least £2 per lot.</p>

<p>A small and select library will naturally average
a much higher amount than a large library, in
which many commonplace books must be included.
These averages, however, will not help
us very much to understand the relative value of
libraries.</p>

<p>For instance, at the Sunderland sale some lots
sold for enormous sums, while a large number fell
for a few shillings; but at the Hamilton Palace sales
(William Beckford and the Duke of Hamilton)
nearly every lot was of value, and although individual
lots did not reach the sums realised at the
Sunderland sale, the total was much larger. As an
instance of what is meant, we may quote from the
notice of the Ashburnham sale in the <span class="lock"><i>Times</i>&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The 1683 lots realised a grand total of £30,151, 10s.,
which works out at an average of as nearly as possible
£18 per lot. Hitherto the highest average was obtained
by the disposal in 1884 of the Syston Park library, where
2110 lots brought £28,000, or £13, 5s. per lot, the next
highest average being that of the Seillière library, sold in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
1887, 1140 lots realising £14,944, or about £13, 2s. per
lot. It is scarcely fair, however, to compare the Ashburnham
collection with either of these two libraries, as the
Seillière was admittedly only the choice portion of the
assemblage of the baron, whilst nearly every lot in the
Syston Park library was of importance. Eliminating from
the Ashburnham collection the hundreds of lots which
realised less than £1 each, the average would be nearer
£40 than £18.”</p></div>

<p>This is all very well in its way, but one lot
fetched £4000, and such an amount would demoralise
any average. Let us therefore see what
are the particular points worthy of notice in the
sums making up this large total of £30,151. We
find that five lots realised £1000 and over each,
and including these five lots, forty-two were over
£100 each. Now the total for these forty-two lots
is £20,348, which, if we deduct from the grand
total, leaves 1641 lots for £9803, bringing our
average down considerably.</p>

<p>This is not perhaps a quite fair system of striking
an average, but it shows better how the prices
of the books are distributed.</p>

<span class="smaller">PRICES OF EARLY PRINTED BOOKS</span></h2>


<p>It is impossible in the following chapters to do
more than select some of the chief classes of valuable
books in order to indicate the changes that
have taken place in the prices. It will be noticed
that the great enhancement of prices which is so
marked a feature of the present age commenced
about the beginning of the present century.</p>

<p>Bibliomania can scarcely be said to have existed
in the seventeenth century, but it commenced in
the middle of the next century, when the Mead
library was sold. Still it attracted little attention
until the sale of the Roxburghe library in 1812,
when it had become a power. In the middle of
the present century there was a dull time, but
during the last quarter the succession of sales realising
one, two, and three thousand pounds have been
continuous, with occasional sales realising much
larger amounts. Great changes have occurred at
different times in the taste of collectors for certain
classes of books.</p>

<p>We may obtain a good idea of the public taste
in books by analysing a list of the highest prices
obtained at three such representative sales as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
Sunderland, the Hamilton Palace, and the Ashburnham
libraries.</p>

<p>At the first of these the largest prices were obtained
for the first editions of Bibles, classics,
Italian poets, &amp;c.; at the second, fine bindings
took the lead; and at the third, Bibles and Caxtons,
and other early literature occupied the first
place.</p>

<p>All these classes are dealt with in the following
chapters. In the present one, the most important
among the early Bibles, the first editions of the
classics, and early Italian literature are recorded.
These are among the chief of those books which
have been steadily rising for years, and now stand
at enormous prices.</p>

<p>It is not safe to prophesy, but there is no reason
to doubt that if riches continue to increase these
prices will also advance. As these books are placed
in great libraries they naturally become scarcer
each year. We must, however, always bear in
mind that the number of libraries and individuals
who can afford to spend thousands of pounds on
single books are few, and if they are reduced, those
who remain in the field are likely to get books
cheaper.</p>

<p>While the first editions of the classics will probably
always keep up their price, later editions
have experienced a fall from which they are never
likely to recover. Scholarship and knowledge of
manuscripts have so greatly advanced, that many
of the old high-priced editions are now hopelessly
out of date, and good German texts, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
can be obtained at a few shillings, are naturally
preferred.</p>

<p>The Delphin and Oxford classics, which were
once so much sought after, have now sunk to a
comparatively low price. The large paper copy of
Dr. Samuel Clarke’s edition of “Cæsar” (2 vols. imp.
folio, 1712), of which only twenty-five copies were
printed, was once a high priced book. The Duke
of Grafton’s copy fetched £64, and Topham Beauclerk’s
£44. There is a story connected with the
latter, which should be noted. Beauclerk gave four
guineas for his copy to the mother of a deceased
officer, the sum she asked, but when he was afterwards
told by his bookseller that it was worth
seventeen guineas, he sent the additional thirteen
guineas to the lady. Certainly the Sunderland copy
fetched £101 in 1881, but this was a special case,
owing to the connection of the great Duke of Marlborough
with the book. The Duke of Hamilton’s
copy, which had belonged to Louis XIV., sold in
1884 for £36; but Beckford’s copy, bound in red
morocco, only brought £6.</p>

<p>Block books are of such excessive rarity that they
have always been high priced, but like the earliest
books printed from movable types, they have greatly
increased in value of late years. This is seen in the
case of the copy of the second edition of the <i>Biblia
Pauperum</i>, which fetched £1050 at the Earl of
Ashburnham’s sale. This same copy brought £257
at Willett’s sale, but at Hanrott’s the price fell to
the small amount of £36, 15s.</p>

depreciation in price of a unique book.</p>

<p>The editor of this series contributed an article on
this copy to <i>The Library</i> (vol. i. p. 106). The arms
of the Borgia family are beautifully painted on the
first page of the text, and it has usually been supposed
that Cardinal Roderigo Borgia (afterwards
Pope Alexander VI.), to whom it belonged, was
Abbot of the monastery of Subiaco (where the
first productions of Sweynheym and Pannartz were
executed) at the time the book was printed. It is
proved in the article, however, that the abbey was
not conferred upon Borgia by Sixtus IV. until 1471,
so that the connection is merely a coincidence.
This magnificent volume was probably executed for
Borgia, whose character, as delineated by Raphael
Volaterranus, is evidently imitated from Livy’s
character of Hannibal.</p>

Mr. Andrew Lang reprinted this in Mr. Nutt’s
Tudor Library, 1890, from the copy in the Bodleian
Library. There is no copy in the British Museum,
and in the introduction to his reprint Lang tells a
story against himself. He bought at Toovey’s a
poor copy of this book for £1, but shortly afterwards
he found that it wanted the last five pages,
and exchanged it for “Les Mémoires de la Reine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
Marguerite,” Paris, 1661, in yellow morocco. He
regretted his exchange when he discovered its great

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX<br />

<span class="smaller">PRICES OF EARLY ENGLISH LITERATURE</span></h2>


<p>No class of books has advanced in value of late
years to so great an extent as the chief examples of
old English literature, and of this class the books
printed by our earliest printer, Caxton, stand in a
foremost position. It is proposed in this chapter to
give a general idea of the variations in price of all
the books printed by Caxton which have been sold
by public auction. The number attached to each
entry is that given by Mr. Blades in his great work,
and it is hoped that few sales of these books have
been left unmentioned.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">57</a></p>

<p>We learn from Mr. Blades that there was no fixed
published price for these books, but the sellers
obtained the best price they could for them. In
1496 the churchwardens of St. Margaret, Westminster,
were possessed of fifteen copies of “The
Golden Legend,” bequeathed by Caxton. Ten of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
these took five years to sell. In 1496 one copy was
sold for 6s. 8d., and in 1500 the price had gone
down to 5s. In 1510 R. Johnson, M.D., bought
five Caxtons (“Godefroy of Boleyn,” “Eneydos,”
“Faytes of Arms,” “Chastising,” and “Book of
Fame”) for a total expenditure of 6s. 8d. These
are now in the University Library, Cambridge.
In the sale of 1678, to which the name of Voetius
is attached, three Caxtons sold for 7s. 10d. At the
sale of Secondary Richard Smith’s library (1682)
eleven Caxtons realised £3, 4s. 2d.; at Dr. Francis
Bernard’s sale (1697), ten for £1, 15s. 4d. There
were a considerable number of Caxtons in the Harleian
Library, and several of these were duplicates.
They do not appear to have sold very readily, and
they occur in several of Osborne’s catalogues at a
fairly uniform price of one guinea for the folios and
15s. for the quartos. At the Hon. Bryan Fairfax’s
sale (1756) nine Caxtons sold for £33, 4s. At James
West’s sale (1773) the price had considerably advanced,
and thirty-four Caxtons realised £361,
4s. 6d. John Ratcliffe’s forty-eight Caxtons brought
£236, 5s. 6d. At Dr. Richard Farmer’s sale (1798)
five sold for £19, 11s. 6d. An astonishing advance
in price is found at the Duke of Roxburghe’s sale
(1812), where fourteen fine Caxtons brought £3002,
1s. At the sale of Stanesby Alchorne’s library in
1813 nine fetched £666, 15s. Ralph Willett’s seven
brought in 1813 £1319, 16s. John Towneley’s nine
sold in 1814 for £1127. The Marquis of Blandford’s
(White Knights) eighteen Caxtons brought in 1819
£1316, 12s. 6d. At Watson Taylor’s sale in 1823<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
nine brought £319, 14s. 6d.; John Inglis (1826),
thirteen for £431, 15s. 6d.; John Dent (1827), four
for £162, 16s. 6d.; George Hibbert (1829), five for
£339, 13s. 6d.; P. A. Hanrott (1833), six for £180,
16s.; R. Heber (1834), six for £219, 16s.; Thomas
Jolley (1843-51), six for £325, 15s.; E. V. Utterson
(1852), three for £116; J. D. Gardner (1854), seven
for £739.</p>

<p>It will be seen from these totals that the present
high prices did not rule at the sales in the middle
of the present century.</p>

<p>In 1897 the total for the ten Caxtons in the first
portion of the Ashburnham library reached £5622,
and the six in the second portion fetched £4264.</p>

<p>The following list contains particulars of the sale
prices of some of the chief issues of Caxton’s <span class="lock">press:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockhang">

<p class="hang"><i>The Recuyell of the Histories of Troy</i> (1).</p>

<p>Dr. Bernard (1698), 3s.; Bryan Fairfax (1756),
£8, 8s. This perfect copy was bought by Francis
Child, and at the sale of the Earl of Jersey’s library
in 1885 it was sold to Mr. Quaritch for £1820.</p>

<p>J. West’s imperfect copy was sold in 1773 to
George III. for £32, 11s., and it was perfected
afterwards.</p>

<p>J. Lloyd of Wygfair (1816), £126. This copy
was bought by G. Hibbert, and at his sale in 1829
J. Wilks bought it for £157, 10s.; at Wilks’s sale in
1847 E. V. Utterson bought it for £165; at Utterson’s
sale in 1852 the Earl of Ashburnham bought
it for £55&mdash;not £155, as stated by Blades. This
was described in Hibbert’s and Wilks’s catalogues
as having “six whole leaves and parts of four others
supplied in facsimile,” but at Utterson’s sale it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>stated to want no less than forty-seven leaves. At
the Ashburnham sale (part 2), 1897, it was said
to want forty-nine leaves. It fetched £950.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>The Game and Play of the Chess</i>, first edition (2).</p>

<p>R. Smith (1682), 13s. 2d.; J. West (1773), sold
to George III. for £32, 0s. 6d.; S. Alchorne (1813),
£54, 12s.&mdash;J. Inglis. J. Inglis (1826), £31, 10s.&mdash;Lord
Audley. Lord Audley (1855), £60, 10s.&mdash;H.
Cunliffe.</p>

<p>White Knights (1819), £36, 15s.&mdash;Duke of
Devonshire. This copy, sold for £42, was found
on collation after the sale to want three leaves
instead of only two, as stated in the catalogue;
it was therefore returned, and sold for £36, 15s.</p>

<p>Sir H. Mainwaring (1837), £101&mdash;J. Holford.
This may be the same copy as R. Smith’s, as it
has on a fly-leaf in manuscript, “Ex dono Thomæ
Delves, Baronett, 1682.”</p>

<p>Old Essex library (Lord Petre), 1886, £645&mdash;Quaritch
(perfect, excepting only the blanks). Earl
of Hardwicke (1888), wanting the Prologue and
three other leaves, £260&mdash;Quaritch.</p>

<p>It is necessary to quote from Scott’s “Antiquary”
a well-known passage, because, as Mr. Blades says,
“not a single statement is founded on fact.” The
particulars are so circumstantial, that they have
possibly deceived many readers, more especially as
Scott himself vouches for the anecdote as literally
true. “Snuffy Davy bought the ‘Game of Chesse,’
1474, the first book ever printed in England, from
a stall in Holland for about 2 groschen, or twopence
of our money. He sold it to Osborne for
£20 and as many books as came to £20 more.
Osborne resold this inimitable windfall to Dr. Askew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>for 60 guineas. At Dr. Askew’s sale this inestimable
treasure blazed forth in its true value, and was
purchased by Royalty itself for one hundred and
seventy pounds.” It may be added that Askew
never had a copy.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Chesse</i>, second edition (34).</p>

<p>Dr. Bernard’s copy (1698) sold for 1s. 6d.</p>

<p>J. Ratcliffe’s (1776) was bought for £16 by R.
Willett; and at his sale in 1813, the Duke of Devonshire
bought it for £173, 5s.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Le Recueil des Histoires de Troyes</i> (3).</p>

<p>James (1760), £2, 12s. 6d.&mdash;Jacob Bryant. This
copy was presented by Bryant to George III., and
made perfect with a few leaves presented by the
Duke of Roxburghe. It was retained by George IV.
when the Kings’ Library was presented to the nation,
and is now at Windsor Castle.</p>

<p>Payne, bookseller (1794), £5, 5s.&mdash;sold to the
Duke of Roxburghe, at whose sale in 1812 it fetched
£116, 11s. It has been sold several times since, each
time for less money. Among Lord Spencer’s duplicates
(1823), for £73, 10s., to J. Dent; at Dent’s
sale in 1827, for £36, 10s., to P. A. Hanrott; at
Hanrott’s sale in 1833, to the Earl of Ashburnham,
for £27. Second part of Ashburnham sale (1897),
£600. Wanting thirty-three leaves.</p>

Spencer (perfect, and uncut).</p>

<p>G. Libri (1844), £200 (a perfect and unusually
fine copy)&mdash;sold to British Museum.</p>

<p>The copy, slightly imperfect, in the National
Library, Paris, was purchased at Brussels in the
early part of the century by M. de la Serna for 150
francs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p class="hang"><i>Les fais du Jason</i> (4).</p>

<p>The perfect copy in the National Library, Paris,
was purchased in 1808 by M. de la Serna for 2 louis
from a stranger, who had obtained it for half that
sum.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Propositio Johannis Russell</i> (7).</p>

<p>The Althorpe copy formerly belonged to John
Brand, and at the sale of his library the Marquis
of Blandford bought it for £2, 5s. At the White
Knights sale in 1819 Lord Spencer bought it for
£126. The Earl of Leicester has the only other
known copy. Both copies are perfect.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Infancia Salvatoris</i> (8).</p>

<p>The only existing copy known is in the Royal
University Library, Göttingen. It was from the
Harleian Library, and was purchased from Osborne
in 1746 for 15s.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>The History of Jason</i> (9).</p>

<p>Richard Smith (1682), 5s. 1d.; Dr. Bernard

<p>John Erskine’s copy was bought in 1817 by G.
Watson Taylor for £162, 15s., but at his sale in
1823 it only brought £95, 11s., Richard Heber
being the purchaser. At Heber’s sale (1834) it was
bought by Payne the bookseller for £87. This
uncut copy, which is the finest known, came afterwards
into the possession of the Earl of Ashburnham.
It sold at the second part of the Ashburnham sale
(1897) for £2100.</p>

<p>The White Knights copy (Marquis of Blandford)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>was sold (1819) for £85, 1s. At W. S. Higgs’s
sale (1831) it was bought by J. Wilks for £87, 3s.,
and at his sale (1847) it was bought by J. Dunn
Gardner for £121. This copy was returned as
wanting a leaf, and resold for £105. Gardner
bought it afterwards from Pickering, who had in the
meantime supplied the leaf from another copy. At
Gardner’s sale (1854) it was bought for Mr. Lenox
for £105.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>The Dictes and Sayings of the Philosophers</i>, first edition
(10).</p>

<p>Francis Child bought his imperfect copy at Bryan
Fairfax’s sale (1756) for £6. It was bound with

(1885) it brought £141.</p>

<p>John Ratcliffe’s copy was bought by Ralph
Willett in 1776 for 15 guineas, and at his own sale

Bodleian Library bought this copy at that sale for
£50. Blades was misled into saying that the Bodleian
gave £199, 15s., by the fact, in this copy some
irresponsible person has altered the price it fetched
at Vincent’s sale to £199, 15s. by the addition of
the figure 1. Fuller Maitland (1885), £165&mdash;Quaritch

the first fourteen printed leaves as well as the two

<p class="hang"><i>The Description of Britain</i> (40).</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>but Mr. Norgate thinks this is a mistake, as
there was no copy in the White Knights sale. Mr.
Holford’s copy and that in the British Museum were
the only known perfect copies until 1884, when Mr.
Quaritch announced in his catalogue (No. 21,842) a
“very fine copy, quite perfect, with all the blanks,

<p class="hang"><i>The Chronicle of St. Albans</i> (circa 1484), the second
book printed at St. Albans, and the first edition of
the Chronicle, was sold at the Earl of Ashburnham’s
sale (1897) to Messrs. J. &amp; J. Leighton for £180. It
was imperfect, but no absolutely perfect copy is known.</p>

<p>In Quaritch’s catalogue, 1884 (No. 355), a copy

<p class="hang"><i>The Boke of St. Albans</i> (1486), a copy perfected in MS.,
was sold at the Roxburghe sale for £147. It was
resold at the White Knights sale for £84. In March
1882 Mr. Quaritch bought it at Christie’s for 600
guineas. The Grenville copy now in the British
Museum has gone through many vicissitudes, which
were graphically described by Dr. Maitland in 1847.
It appears that at the end of the last century the library
of Thonock Hall, in the parish of Gainsborough, the
seat of the Hickman family, was sorted out by an
ignorant person who threw into a condemned heap
all books without covers. A gardener who took an
interest in heraldry begged permission to take home
what he liked from this heap, and he chose among
other books <i>The Book of St. Albans</i>. This remained
in his cottage till June 1844, when his son’s widow
sold 9 lbs. of books to a pedlar for 9d. The pedlar
sold the lot for 3s. to a chemist in Gainsborough,
who was rather struck by <i>The Book of St. Albans</i>,
and tried to sell it, but the neighbours did not wish
to buy it. Eventually he obtained £2, 2s. for it
from a man who expected to sell it to advantage.
The purchaser sold it to Stark the bookseller for
£7, 7s. Stark took it to London and sold it to
the Right Hon. Thomas Grenville for seventy or
eighty guineas. Mr. Blades communicated this
account to <i>Notes and Queries</i> (3rd Series, iv. 369).</p>

<p>A copy was sold at the Earl of Ashburnham’s sale
(1897), which was stated to be the Roxburghe copy,
completed by the Earl from another copy. Mr.
Quaritch bought this for £385.</p></div>

<p>According to Ritson, this book “was staid at the

Dibdin gives an amusing account of the Roxburghe
Club reprint (1815) in his “Reminiscences” (vol. i.
p. 465, note):&mdash;“A bet was laid (the winner of the
bet to give the Roxburghe Club a dinner) between
Sir M. M. Sykes and Mr. Dent whether the anniversary
meeting of 1815 was the third or fourth of the
club. Mr. Dent was the loser, when Mr. Heber
promised to present the club with a reprint of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>above poem at the extra dinner in contemplation.
Only nine days intervened, but within that period
the reprint was transcribed, superintended at the

bound by Charles Lewis, and presented to the

a pen in his hand during the whole period of its

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X<br />

<span class="smaller">PRICES OF SHAKESPEARE’S WORKS</span></h2>


<p>The first edition of Shakespeare’s Plays (folio, 1623)
has been rising in price from the commencement of
the nineteenth century; but the enormous prices
now paid do not date further back than 1864, when
a specially fine copy was bought by the Baroness
Burdett-Coutts at George Daniel’s sale for £716, 2s.
This amount was paid on account of the height of
the book and of its great beauty, and possibly the
circumstance of the year being the tercentenary of
Shakespeare’s birth had something to do with it,
but this sale had the effect of raising the price of
all copies permanently.</p>

<p>Beloe, writing in 1807 (“Anecdotes,” vol. i. p. 36),
said, “Perhaps there is no book in the English
language which has risen so rapidly in value as the
first edition of the works of our great national poet.
I can remember a very fine copy to have been sold
for five guineas. I could once have purchased a
superb one for nine guineas.” This statement can
be corroborated; for the Cracherode copy in the
British Museum, one of the few really fine copies,
has the price £8, 18s. 6d. marked in it. Richard
Wright’s copy sold in 1787 for £10, Allen’s in 1795<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
for 18 guineas. Farmer’s copy (wanting title, and
with the last leaf in MS.) sold for £7. Garrick
bought his copy from Payne for £1, 16s. Jolley
obtained it at Garrick’s sale in 1823 for £34, 2s. 6d.,
and at Jolley’s sale in 1844 it realised £84. Lord
Denbigh’s fine copy sold in 1825 for £89, 5s.,
and Broadley’s in 1832 for £51; William Combes’s
copy (wanting title-page and all prefatory leaves,
but with the text of the Plays complete) fetched
8 guineas in 1837; Bright’s copy (1845), with title
repaired, verses from another edition, and some
leaves inlaid, brought £31, 10s. The Stowe copy
(1849), with verses inlaid, £76; Hawtrey’s (1853),
with some leaves mended, £63. In 1824 Mr. Thorpe
the bookseller advertised a set of the four folios&mdash;first,
£65; second, 10 guineas; third, £25; and the
fourth, 6 guineas, or the four for £100. About the
same time Mr. Pickering marked a similar set £95.</p>

<p>Copies of the first folio are so constantly sold that
one might suppose it to be a common book, but this
may be accounted for by the fact that they are constantly
changing hands. There are only a few copies
absolutely perfect, but others are made up from
various copies, or with pages in facsimile. This
makes the most imperfect copies of value, because
they can be used to perfect others.</p>

<p>Dibdin described thirty copies of the first folio in
his “Library Companion,” and these he arranged
in three classes. In the first class he placed three
copies, belonging respectively to Mr. Cracherode,
the Right Hon. Thomas Grenville, and Mr. Daniel
Moore. The first two are now in the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
Museum, and the third is the Daniel copy, for
which Lilly the bookseller offered £300.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“These have size, condition, and the genuine properties
of a true copy. They are thirteen inches in height, eight
and a half in width, have the true portrait and title-page,
with the genuine verses in the centre of the leaf facing the
title-page. They have no spurious leaves foisted in from
other editions.... Of these three copies, that in the
Cracherode collection is the most objectionable, as the
commendatory verses of Ben Jonson, facing the title-page,
are, although genuine, inlaid.”</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Grenville’s copy was bought at Saunders’s sale
in 1818 for £121, 16s., which was then thought to
be a great sum, and Dibdin makes the unfortunate
prophecy that this was “the highest price ever
given, or likely to be given, for the volume.” Mr.
Grenville told Dibdin that an ancestor of Sir Watkin
Williams Wynn possessed an uncut copy of the first
folio. “It was lying on the table in that condition
when, in a luckless moment, a stationer in the neighbourhood
of Wynnstay came in. The book was
given to him to be bound, and off went not only
the edges, but half of the margins.” Another piece
of vandalism was the inlaying the leaves of the book
and binding them in three volumes. This was
Henderson the actor’s copy, which sold at Reed’s
sale for £38. In the second class were included
some very good copies.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Lord Spencer’s copy had every leaf picked by the
experienced hands of the late George Steevens. The verses
opposite are genuine, but inlaid, and there are many tender<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
leaves throughout. There are also in the centre of some of the
pages a few greasy-looking spots, which might have originally
received the ‘flakes of pie-crust’ in the servants’ hall, as notified
by Steevens.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> But it is a beautiful and desirable copy.”</p>
</div>

<p>The price mentioned by Steevens is that which
the Duke of Roxburghe gave for his copy in 1790,
respecting which Dibdin relates an anecdote that
took his fancy so much, that he tells the story both
at the beginning and at the end of his <i>Bibliomania</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A friend was bidding for him in the sale-room: his
Grace had retired to a distance to view the issue of the
contest. Twenty guineas and more were offered from
various quarters for the book: a slip of paper was handed
to the Duke, in which he was requested to inform his friend
whether he was ‘to go on bidding.’ His Grace took his
pencil and wrote underneath, by way of <span class="lock">reply&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i16">‘Lay on, Macduff;</div>
<div class="line">And d&mdash;d be he who first cries, “Hold, enough!”’</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Such a spirit was irresistible, and bore down all opposition.
His Grace retired triumphant, with the book under his arm.”</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>A rather different version of this story of Nicol’s
purchase for the Duke is given in Martin’s “Privately
Printed Books.”</p>

<p>This copy sold at the Roxburghe sale for £100,
and is now in the Duke of Devonshire’s library.
Dibdin had a commission from Sir Mark Masterman
Sykes to give £75.</p>

<p>Hibbert’s copy was pronounced by Mr. Amyot
to be the best copy he had seen after those placed
in the first class. It belonged to “Dog” Jennings,
and was purchased of Mr. Payne for 70 guineas.
At Hibbert’s sale it fetched 81 guineas, and was
resold in 1847 at Wilks’s sale for £155. It again
occurred at Dunn Gardner’s sale (1854), when it
was bought by Mr. H. Huth for £250.</p>

<p>Dent’s copy was a tall copy, identical in measurement
with Daniel’s, and with some rough leaves,
but the title and verses were pasted down. It
was bought by H. Perkins for £110, 5s., and at
Perkins’s sale it realised £585, 10s.</p>

<p>John Kemble’s copy was inlaid on large paper,
and bound by Mackinlay. It was purchased by
Mr. Boswell for £112, 7s., and at his sale it brought
£105.</p>

<p>In the third class are the <span class="lock">following:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Steevens’s copy was given to him by Jacob Tonson
in 1765, and it had passed through the hands of
Theobald and Dr. Johnson, the “latter not having
improved its condition.” It wants the title and
portrait, the latter being supplied by a facsimile
drawing by Steevens. The verses are from the
second edition. Dr. Charles Burney bought this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
at the sale of Steevens’s library for £22. It is now
in the British Museum. Nassau’s copy was perfect,
with the exception that the verses were from the
second edition. It was bought by Mr. Thorpe for
£49, 7s.</p>

<p>E. V. Utterson’s copy was fair, with title and
portrait mounted, verses inlaid, and several leaves
mended. It sold for £49 in 1852.</p>

<p>Colonel Stanley’s copy was in fair condition, but
wanted the original verses and title-page. It was
bought at Stanley’s sale by Mr. North for £37, 16s.,
and at North’s sale it realised £39, 18s.</p>

<p>Heber gave 10 guineas for his copy, which wanted
verses, list of actors, &amp;c., title a reprint from the
second edition, some leaves stained, and others
mutilated. This sold at Heber’s sale (1834) for
£57, 15s.</p>

<p>A copy of the first folio is now looked upon as a
necessary addition to a first-class library, but there
was no copy in the libraries of the Earl of Oxford,
Dr. Mead, West, Askew, Crofts, Beauclerk, Heath,
Willett, Bindley, or in the Sunderland or Hamilton
Palace libraries.</p>

<p>Mr. Robert Holford is said to have given £250
for his tall copy.</p>

<h3>SECOND FOLIO, 1632.</h3>

<p>The most interesting copy of the second folio is
in the King’s Library. It belonged to Dr. Mead, at
whose sale it was bought by Askew for £2, 12s. 6d.
At Askew’s sale it was bought by Steevens for £5,
10s., an amount which he styled enormous. At
Steevens’s sale this copy was bought for George
III. for eighteen guineas. It formerly belonged to
Charles I., who wrote in it, “Dum spiro spero, C.R.”
The King presented it the night before his execution
to Sir Thomas Herbert, who had written, “Ex
dono serenissimi Regis Car. Servo suo Humiliss.
T. Herbert.” Steevens mistook the identity of
this Herbert, and wrote, “Sir Thomas Herbert
was Master of the Revels to King Charles the
First.” George III. wrote beneath Steevens’s
note, “This is a mistake, he (Sir Thomas Herbert)
having been Groom of the Bed-Chamber to King
Charles I., but Sir Henry Herbert was Master of
the Revels.”</p>

<p>Dibdin made the same mistake with respect to
this price that he did with respect to the price of
the Grenville first folio. He wrote, “£18, 18s.&mdash;the
largest sum ever given, or likely to be given, for the
book.” Now in 1895, at the Earl of Orford’s sale,
the largest and finest copy known of the second
folio, in the original calf binding, sold for the
enormous sum of £540. This is out of all proportion
to the price of the first folio, and a ridiculous
amount to pay for a volume of little interest by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
itself, and only of value as one of the four original
editions.</p>

<p>The next largest price realised for a second folio
was £148 for Daniel’s copy, which has some rough
leaves, and was bought by Daniel from Thorpe, who
bought it at the Nevill Holt sale for £28, 1s.</p>

<p>The Earl of Aylesford’s copy, with title laid down,
and without verses (13-3/16 in. by 8-3/4 in.) sold in 1888
for £140. Brayton Ives’s perfect copy was sold in
New York in 1891 for 400 dollars (£80). Birket
Foster’s copy sold in 1894 for £56.</p>

<p>It is only lately that such high prices have been
obtained for this edition. The following is a list of
some of the prices given at an earlier <span class="lock">date:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockhang">

<p>B. Worsley (1678), 16s. Digby (1680), 14s.
Richard Wright, M.D. (1787), £2, 9s. and £1, 6s.
Allen (1795), £4, 4s. Stanley (1813), £13, 2s. 6d.
Heber, Part 1, £10, 5s.; Part 4, wanting verses
opposite title-page, and last leaf inlaid, £3, 7s.
Valpy (1832), £18; resold to Broadley (1832),
£12, 5s. Stowe (1849), £11, 5s.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Copies Sold within the Last Twenty-five Years:</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>H. Perkins (1873), £44 (fine copy). Well-known
collector (Sotheby’s), 1880, £12, 15s. (verses
from fourth edition printed, part of title in facsimile
reprint). Ouvry (1882), £46. Beresford-Hope
(1882), £35, 10s. (title mended).</p>

<p>Standard English Works (Puttick’s), 1886, £19.
F. Perkins (1889), large copy, but worm-hole through
half the volume, £47. W. H. Crawford (1891),
wanting verses, £19, 10s. Smithson and others,
1896 (Puttick’s), £18, 5s. (verses and several pages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
wanting, and a few worm-holes). Jack, Halliday,
&amp;c. (Sotheby, July 1897), £55 (fine copy, portrait
and verses mended).</p>

<p>Sir Henry Irving gave £100 for Dr. Johnson’s
copy of the second folio, which contains many notes
in the margin by Theobald and Johnson. Osborn
the bookseller bought it at Theobald’s death and
presented it to Johnson. Samuel Ireland gave £1
for it at Johnson’s sale in 1785. It wants title and
part of another leaf.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">59</a></p>
</div>


<h3>THIRD FOLIO, 1664 (some copies dated 1663).</h3>

<p>This edition is scarcer than the second, owing to
the copies having been destroyed in the Fire of
London. The title-page of 1663 has the portrait,
and that of 1664 is without it. Mr. Thorpe, in one
of his catalogues, said that he had “refused £10
for the title of 1663.” Mr. Quaritch gave £11 for
one in 1895 at Sotheby’s.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI<br />

<span class="smaller">PRICES OF VARIOUS CLASSES OF BOOKS</span></h2>


<p>In this chapter some account will be given of a
few of the various classes of literature which have
not previously been alluded to; but to give a
general idea of some of these books which bring
a high price, it will be necessary to be brief.</p>

<p>Oldys refers to the sale of a book which he
supposes to have been erroneously valued, but
he was not quite correct in his statement. He
wrote, “The atheistical book of Giordano Bruno
sold at Paul’s Coffee-house for £30 in 1709; it
has scarcely sold for so many pence since.”<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">60</a></p>

<p>The book referred to was&mdash;Giordano Bruno,
<i>Spaccio de la Bestia Trionfante. Parigi</i> (Londra:
T. Vautrollier 1584), the sale of which is commented
upon in <i>The Spectator</i>, No. 389. The sale
at which this book occurred was that of Charles
Bernard in 1711, and the amount was really £28.
The purchaser was Walter Clavel, and this copy
was successively in the possession of John Nichols,
John Ames, Sir Peter Thompson, and M. C. Tutet.
At the sale of the latter’s library in 1786 it was
bought by Samuel Tyssen for seven guineas.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
Another copy, which had formed part of the library
of Mr. P. Le Neve, was sold at Dr. Mead’s sale
(1754) for four or five guineas.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> The price has
not gone down, as Oldys supposed it would, for
at the Dunn Gardner sale (1880) a copy brought
£20, 15s., and another, at the Duke of Hamilton’s
sale (1884), sold for £18, 10s.</p>

<p>There is a larger circle of bibliophiles in France
than in England, and they are more willing to pay
high prices for out-of-the-way books. The early
editions of Molière and Rabelais, like those of
Shakespeare, are sold for large sums, and early
French literature generally, like our own, has
greatly advanced in price of late years.</p>

<p>Two instances of the great advance that has
occurred may be <span class="lock">given:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Perrault, <i>Contes de ma Mere Loye</i>, 1697, wanting
leaf of errata, a fine copy, in blue morocco by
Bauzonnet, sold at Charles Nodier’s sale for 112
francs. The same copy at the Duke of Hamilton’s
sale brought £85.</p>

<p>Gringoire, <i>Les Fantasies de Mere Sote</i> (Paris, 1516),
a copy in blue morocco by Padeloup, sold at
Hibbert’s sale for nine guineas. The same copy
brought the large sum of £180 at Beckford’s sale.
One can understand such high prices as these,
which arise from the revived interest felt in this
kind of book, but the high price of <i>Le Pastissier
François</i> (Amsterdam: L. &amp; D. Elzevier, 1655)
seems absurd. Such a book can be of little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
interest to English buyers, although certainly Mr.
Andrew Lang grows enthusiastic over it in his
“Books and Bookmen.” In an early edition of his
<i>Manuel</i> (1821) Brunet <span class="lock">wrote&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Till now I have disdained to admit this book into my
work, but I have yielded to the prayers of amateurs.
Besides, how could I keep out a volume which was sold
for one hundred and one francs in 1819?”</p></div>

<p>The book has greatly increased in value since
then, and, as a consequence, copies not hitherto
known have come into the market. Berard only
knew of two copies. Pietiers, writing on the Elzevirs
in 1843, could cite only five, and in his
<i>Annales</i> he had found out but five more. Willems,
on the other hand, enumerates some thirty, not including
Motteley’s.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> Mr. Lang himself calculates
the number of <i>Pastissiers</i> now existing at forty, and
gives a good many prices to show how the book
has increased in value. A copy was sold in 1780
for 4 francs. Sensièr’s copy sold for 128 francs
in 1828, and for 201 francs in 1837. It was afterwards
bound by Trautz-Bauzonnet, and sold with
Potier’s books in 1870 for 2910 francs. At the
Benzon sale (1875) it fetched 3255 francs, and was
sold again in 1877 for 2200 francs. Mr. Lang
further says that a copy was marked in Bachelin-Deflorenne’s
catalogue at £240, and that Morgand
and Fatout sold an uncut copy for £400. The
Earl of Orford’s copy sold in 1895 for £100.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>
<p>This is one of the very few books that are absolutely
valueless, except in regard to such value as it
gains from its rarity and association with a great
firm of printers; yet Mr. Lang says that “there are
at least four thousand people who would greatly
rejoice to possess a <i>Pastissier</i>, and some of these
desirous ones are very wealthy.” This is amazing,
but I suppose it would scarcely be polite to refer to
Carlyle’s verdict as to what the mass of people are.</p>

<p>Another scarce book, which is stupid, and of no
interest in itself, is Horace Walpole’s “Hieroglyphic
Tales” (1785). The British Museum does not possess
a perfect copy, but it has some of Walpole’s own
corrected proofs bound up in a volume. The Earl
of Orford’s copy, interleaved and bound in morocco
by Roger Payne, sold in 1895 for £37.</p>

<p>County histories vary in price, but they must
always hold their ground and sell well, on account
of the value of the information contained in their
pages, which cannot easily be found elsewhere.
They may be considered as eminently safe property.
The following are the prices of a few of <span class="lock">these:&mdash;</span></p>

</div>

<p>First editions of our English classics have increased
greatly in price of late years. Many of
Defoe’s works are very scarce, and bring good prices.
The late Mr. James Crossley had a fine collection
of these, but his library was in such poor condition
that the books did not sell well. The British
Museum bought at his sale, June 20, 1885, the autograph
manuscript of Defoe’s “Compleat English
Gentleman,” which had never been printed until
Mr. Nutt issued it to subscribers in 1890. The
manuscript remained in the possession of Defoe’s
relations, the Baker family, for more than a hundred
years, as Dawson Turner bought it in 1831 from
the Rev. H. D. F. Baker, the descendant of Henry
Baker, son-in-law of Defoe, for £69. In 1859, at
the sale of Turner’s MSS., Crossley bought the
book for £75, 8s.</p>

<h3>BOOKS ON VELLUM</h3>

<p>Collectors have always had a fancy for these very
choice books, and that the taste has not yet died
out is seen from the fact that the late William
Morris printed copies of the beautiful books issued
from the Kelmscott Press on vellum, and was particularly
careful in the selection of the skins, which
he obtained at first from Italy. A complete set of
all the books on vellum (including Chaucer), forty-nine
volumes, were offered at the Kelmscott Press
for £650, and have been sold at that price.</p>

<p>We can understand the early printed books being
struck off upon vellum, as the printers appreciated
that material on account of its use by the scribes
in the production of the beautiful manuscripts of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
former age, but it is surely infinitely more convenient
to have a book printed on good paper
rather than on such a refractory material as vellum.
Some collectors have been so infatuated as to
confine their libraries to books printed on vellum,
and the French Marshal Junot was one of them.
Modern books were printed for him on this substance;
but when they came to be sold it was found
that the public did not care much for his books, and
more than half of them were bought in. One of the
lots illustrates in a remarkable manner the advance
in prices at the present time. The book was Longus’s
<i>Pastoralia</i>, printed by Didot in 1802. One
copy only was pulled on vellum for the Marshal,
and this volume contained the original drawings of
Proudhon, and a set of proof impressions of the
engravings. At the Junot sale in 1816 this book
only realised £37, 10s.; at the Beckford sale it
brought £900. One of the most charming of
Junot’s books was the Didot <i>Horace</i> of 1799 folio,
a volume which contained the original drawings
from which the copperplate vignettes were executed.
This was bought by George Hibbert for
£140.</p>

<p>Of old books, mention may be made of the
dedication copy to James V. of John Bellenden’s
translation of Hector Boece’s “Cronikles of Scotland”
(1536), which was printed on vellum, and
which, in a fine old binding, realised at the Duke
of Hamilton’s sale (1884), £800.</p>

<p>Dibdin styled this hobby of collectors the fifth
symptom of the bibliomania, and he gave a list of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
the vellum-printed books in Count MacCarthy’s
and James Edwards’s libraries. In the latter collection
was a copy of Martin Luther’s German
Bible (Augsburg, 1535, two vols. folio), which sold
for the reasonable price of £52, 10s. These copies
on vellum were printed at the charge of John
Frederick, Elector of Saxony.</p>

<p>Edwards employed Bodoni to print for him six
copies of the edition of the “Castle of Otranto”
(Parma, 1791) on vellum, and his own copy, made
up with a selection of the best sheets, sold at his
sale in 1815 for £29, 8s.</p>

<p>At Watson Taylor’s sale Pope’s “Essay on Man”
(1819), printed on vellum, sold for £10.</p>

<p>Mention has already been made of the grand
copies on vellum of the earliest productions of the
printing-press&mdash;the Mazarin Bible, &amp;c.</p>


<h3>ILLUSTRATED BOOKS</h3>

<p>Good illustrated books, which are an ornament to
any library, are now high priced, and are not likely
to fall in value. Such books as Dibdin’s bibliographical
works, Rogers’s “Italy” and “Poems,”
and many other books of a like kind, must always
be a delight to the æsthetic collector.</p>

<p>Collections of engraved portraits have realised
great prices, such as Holland’s <i>Basiliωgia</i> (1618),
which sold for £600 at Christie’s in 1811; and his
<i>Herωologia</i> (1620), which sold for £17 at the
Beckford sale, £28, 10s. at the Earl of Crawford’s
sale (1887), and £19, 15s. at W. H. Crawford<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>’s
(Lakelands) sale (1891); and the superb series of
Vandyck’s etchings, which sold for £2850 at the
Beckford sale.</p>

<p>Great prices have also been paid for extra illustrated
books; but it is useless to record the prices
given for them, unless a list of the contents is given
also. Grangerising has been ridiculed with much
justice, and some of the bulky works which have
been produced, such as the illustrated Bibles and
Shakespeares, are instances of a very absurd mania.
Dr. Hill Burton gave an amusing and by no
means exaggerated sketch in his “Book Hunter”
of how the compiler set about his work. Now in
England Grangerising is mostly confined within
the limits of illustrating topographical works with
views and historical books with portraits, but in
the United States the old plan is said to be still
in force.</p>


<h3>BINDINGS</h3>

<p>In no class of books have prices more conspicuously
advanced than in the case of bindings, and
in many sales that have taken place of late years
fine specimens have been brought to the hammer;
but no sale could compare with that of the Beckford
library in this respect. Good examples of the libraries
of Margaret of Valois, Maioli, Grolier, Thuanus,
and Canevari are eagerly sought after, and the
following prices of some of the choicest of these
bindings will give readers an idea of the current
values of these charming <span class="lock">books:&mdash;</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>A few instances of the work of the great French
binders follow, and it will be seen that the work of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
no binder is more appreciated by collectors than
that of <span class="lock">Monnier:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="hang"><i>Clovis Eve.</i> Coloured Drawings of Maps and Plans of

<p class="hang"><i>Boyet.</i> In the second portion of the Sunderland library
there was a small volume in old crimson morocco
(Cicero, <i>De Officiis</i>, Amst. ex off. Elzeviriani, 1677),
which was not specially described, nor the title
printed in capitals. It did not look worth many
pounds, but Mr. Quaritch obtained it after an exciting
contest with Mr. Morgand for £120. The
cause of the excitement was this: from the character
of the end papers it was judged that the book had
been bound by the French binder Boyet. Specimens
of his handiwork are very rare, and hence the
great price.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Deseuil</i> (or <i>Du Seuil</i>). In the second portion of the
Beckford library was a copy of the Leyden edition
of Macrobius (1670), bound in red morocco doublé
by Deseuil. This fetched £39, while another copy
in vellum only realised 16s.</p>

<p>Here is another instance of the increased value of
a copy of a book bound by a good binder. A copy
of Montaigne, <i>Essais</i>, 3 vols. 8vo (Amst.: Elzevir,
1659), bound in red morocco double by Deseuil,
brought £200, while another copy, bound by Roger
Payne in red morocco, only sold for £12, 10s.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>

<p>A small duodecimo volume bound by Deseuil
(Longus, Les Amours Pastorales de Daphnis et
Chloe, <i>Paris</i>, 1788) was sold at G. Daniel’s sale
in 1864 for £92.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Monnier.</i> Decor Puellarum (Venetia: N. Jenson, 1471).
Girardot de Prefond’s copy, a magnificent specimen
of Monnier’s binding, in blue morocco, ornamented
with flowers worked on variegated leathers, and
stamped in gold.</p>

<p>Beckford (1883), £530.</p>

<p class="hang">&mdash;&mdash; De l’Imitation de Jesus Christ traduction nouvelle
(Paris, 1690). Large paper. Citron morocco, magnificent
specimen of Monnier’s binding.</p>

<p>Beckford (1882), £356.</p>

<p class="hang">&mdash;&mdash; Corneille, Rodogune. Au Nord [Versailles], 1760.
Madame de Pompadour’s own copy, printed under
her eyes in a northern apartment of the Palace of
Versailles, in yellow morocco; fine specimen of
Monnier’s binding.</p>

<p>Beckford (1882), £325.</p>
</div>

<p>It has hitherto been the fine French and Italian
bindings that have fetched the high prices, but now
some of the beautiful English bindings of the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries are coming in for
their share of consideration. At the Earl of Orford’s
sale (1895) R. Wood’s “Essay on Homer” (1785),
bound by Roger Payne by order of Wood’s widow
for presentation to Horace Walpole, sold for ten
guineas. There is an interest in this book as having
fallen into the hands of Goethe when his powers
were first developing themselves, and it strongly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
interested him. Robert Wood was Under-Secretary
of State in 1762, and he related an affecting anecdote
of Lord Granville, a statesman known now only to
the few. Wood was directed to wait upon the
President of the Council (Lord Granville) a few
days before he died with the preliminary articles of
the Treaty of Paris. “I found him,” he continued,
“so languid that I proposed postponing my business
for another time; but he insisted that I should stay,
saying that it could not prolong his life to neglect
his duty,” adding a quotation from Homer, which
may be found in Mr. Matthew Arnold’s discourses
on Homeric translations.</p>


<h3>EARLY EDITIONS OF MODERN AUTHORS</h3>

<p>The last five-and-twenty years has seen the rise of
a new taste in early editions of the works of modern
authors, and a new class of bibliographers has arisen
to describe these books.</p>

<p>Mr. J. H. Slater (the editor of “Book Prices
Current”) has published a useful guide to this subject,
entitled “Early Editions: a Bibliographical
Survey of the Works of some popular Modern
Authors. London, 1894.”</p>

<p>I have taken some particulars from this book,
and supplemented them with a note of the prices
realised at the remarkable sale of Mr. Alfred
Crampton’s collection in 1896. I have also added
a few books sold since that date.</p>

<p>Among the first of modern books to sell for high
prices were the illustrated novels of Dickens and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
Thackeray, and to be valuable these must be in
perfect condition, with the original wrappers, &amp;c.
After these come the other books illustrated by
Cruikshank, “Phiz,” Leech, and others, viz., Ainsworth’s
and Lever’s novels, Surtees’ Sporting novels&mdash;“Sponge’s
Sporting Tour,” “Jorrocks’s Jaunts,”
“Handley Cross,” &amp;c.</p>

<p>Of poets, Shelley’s pieces were among the first to
attain high prices, and Byron’s among the last.</p>

<p><i>Arnold.</i>&mdash;Matthew Arnold’s “Strayed Reveller.
By A.,” 1849, and “Empedocles on Etna,” 1852,
have long been classed among the rare books. The
former was published at 4s. 6d., and its usual price
now is £4, but a copy has fetched £7. The latter
was published at 6s., and is now valued at from
£3, 10s. to £6.</p>

<div class="blockhang">

<p class="hang">Beckford, <i>Poetical Sketches</i>.</p>

<p>Gaisford (1890), £40.</p>

<p class="hang">Blake (W.), <i>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</i> [1789].
Engraved and coloured by Blake, in green morocco
by Lewis.</p>

<p>Sir W. Tite, £61. Lord Beaconsfield, £85.
Beckford (1882), £146.</p>

<p class="hang">&mdash;&mdash; <i>Milton: a Poem.</i> Engraved throughout, and ornamented
with designs by Blake, blue morocco by
Mackenzie.</p>

<p>Beckford (1882), £230.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Browning.</i>&mdash;Robert Browning’s first publication,
which appeared when its author was in his twenty-first
year, is a great rarity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>“Pauline; a Fragment of a Confession. ‘Plus ne
suis ce que j’ai été, Et ne le sçaurois jamais être.’&mdash;<i>Marot.</i>
London: Saunders &amp; Otley, Conduit
Street, 1833.”</p>

<p>Mr. Slater says that there are about eight copies
known, and that it was supposed to be worth £40
or £50. A copy, with an autograph note by the
author, was sold at Alfred Crampton’s sale for
£145. Mr. Thomas J. Wise printed a facsimile
reprint in 1886, which has been used by the forger
to deceive. Mr. Slater had seen a “doctored”
copy of this reprint, in which Wise’s title and prefatory
note were removed, the paper was rotted to
make it porous, and the leaves were smoked to give
them a mellow appearance. Mr. Wise’s paper is
thicker than the original, and Mr. Slater gives a
hint how to distinguish the <span class="lock">two:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“On the final page (71) appear the words&mdash;‘Richmond,
October 22, 1832.’ If the word ‘October’ is printed in
<i>thin</i> italics the book is without doubt a reprint. So far as
I am aware, there is no other difference between Mr. Wise’s
excellent reprint and the original (the paper excepted).”</p></div>

<p><i>Burns.</i>&mdash;The most amazing price ever realised
for a modern book was that of £572 for “Poems
chiefly in the Scottish dialect. By Robert Burns.
<i>Kilmarnock</i>, 1786.” The original price of this
octavo volume was three shillings. The history
of the very fine copy sold in Edinburgh in February
1898 is traced back about eighty years by
a writer in <i>Literature</i>. In 1870 it was sold for six
guineas to G. B. Simpson, of Dundee, who sold it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
in 1879, with some other books, to A. C. Lamb for
£124. The price of the Kilmarnock Burns has
steadily advanced from £3, 10s. in 1858 to £111
in 1888, and then it made the immense leap to
£572.</p>

<p><i>Byron.</i>&mdash;“Poems on Various Occasions” (Newark,
1807, 8vo) sold at Alfred Crampton’s sale for £45.
“The Waltz” (1813, pp. 27), published without a
wrapper at 3s., sold at the same sale for £55. Mr.
Slater says that an uncut copy has been sold by
auction for £86.</p>

<p><i>Meredith.</i>&mdash;A fine uncut copy of George Meredith’s
Poems, 1851, sold at a sale of Rare Books
and Manuscripts (Sotheby, March 1897) for £17,
10s. Another copy with alterations in the author’s
autograph (Sotheby, June 1897) sold for £25.</p>

<p><i>Morris.</i>&mdash;The beautiful issues of William Morris’s
Kelmscott Press advanced in price in many instances
before publication, and are likely, now that
the supply has ceased, to advance still more; but
they vary very much according to the literary rank
of the books. The edition of Keats, published at
30s., was sold lately for £12. Shelley’s Poetical
Works, in three volumes 8vo, was sold at Sotheby’s
early in 1898 for £8. Chaucer’s Works, folio, is
out of print, and was marked by Messrs. J. &amp; J.
Leighton at £30.</p>

<p><i>Rossetti.</i>&mdash;The first printed work of Dante G.
Rossetti is of great rarity. The poet was thirteen
years old when the lines were composed, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
fifteen when they were printed. The title is “Sir
Hugh the Heron: a Legendary Tale, in four parts.
G. Polidori’s Private Press, 15 Park Village East,
1843. Private Circulation only,” pp. 24. A copy was
sold at Sotheby’s in 1890 for £16. Miss Christina
Rossetti’s first poems, privately printed at the same
press, have brought seven guineas.</p>

<p><i>Ruskin.</i>&mdash;“Poems by J. R., collected in 1850 for
private circulation only,” a foolscap octavo volume
of 283 pages, is valued at £50 or £60. The value
of his sumptuous books, “The Stones of Venice,”
the “Seven Lamps of Architecture,” and “Modern
Painters,” is known to all, and when in good condition
they look their value. The original editions
of the first, 1851 to 1853, are valued at from £12
to £15. The first edition of the “Seven Lamps,”
1849, at £4, and the second edition, 1855, at
£4, 10s. The “Modern Painters,” 5 vols., early
editions, from £20 to £25.</p>

<p><i>Shelley.</i>&mdash;The early editions of Shelley’s Poems
and Prose Treatises were amongst the first of this
class of books to attain high prices. Some may
be noted here in chronological <span class="lock">order:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Zastrozzi: a Romance,” 1810, was published at
5s. Bound and cut copies have sold for £5, 15s.,
and £12, 5s. An uncut copy, in calf, fetched £12,
5s. in 1890, and an uncut copy in morocco brought
fifteen guineas in 1897 (Sir C. S. Forbes).</p>

<p>The most interesting of these pamphlets is the
one which was the cause of its author being expelled
from University College, Oxford.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>“The Necessity of Atheism. Worthing. Printed
by E. &amp; W. Phillips. Sold in London and Oxford,”
n.d. [1811] f. 8vo, pp. 13.</p>

<p>Nearly all the copies were destroyed by the
printers, and Mr. Slater values a clean copy at
about £20, but probably it would realise much
more than that.</p>

<p>“St. Irvyne,” 1811, morocco uncut, Sir C. S.
Forbes, 1897, £16, 10s.</p>

<p>“An Address to the Irish People” (Dublin, 1812)
was published at 5d., and Mr. Slater values a copy
at £8 to £12, but one was sold at Alfred Crampton’s
sale, 1896, for £42.</p>

<p>“Queen Mab,” 1813, in the original boards, was
sold in 1891 for £22, 10s.</p>

<p>“The Refutation of Deism,” 1814, fetched £33 at
an auction in 1887.</p>

<p>The largest price, however, given for one of
these pamphlets was £130 for “Œdipus Tyrannus,”
1820, at Crampton’s sale. The entire impression
was destroyed except seven copies, only two or
three of which are known to exist, but a reprint
on vellum appeared in 1876. The British
Museum possesses a copy, presented by Lady
Shelley.</p>

<p><i>Tennyson.</i>&mdash;The first editions of Tennyson’s
Poems bring high prices, and the scarcest is the
famous “Poems by Two Brothers,” 1827, published
for 5s., and large paper for 7s. The present value
of the former is about £15 to £10.</p>

<p>The original MS. was sold in December 1892 to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
Messrs. Macmillan &amp; Bowes of Cambridge for £480.
After a facsimile had been taken, it was resold to
an American collector.</p>

<p><i>Dickens.</i>&mdash;“Sunday under Three Heads” was one
of the first of the novelist’s works to sell for a high
price. As it is a very small book, it is not saying
much to describe it as selling for its weight in gold;
in point of fact, it sells for more. Mr. F. C. Kitton
gives the market value of the various novels in
his “Novels of Charles Dickens,” 1897. The first
edition of the “Memoirs of Joseph Grimaldi” sold
in July 1897 at Sotheby’s (Jack, Halliday, &amp;c.) for
£8, 17s. 6d.</p>

<p><i>Thackeray.</i>&mdash;Thackerayana is very high priced,
and the following two instances of sales in 1897
show that the tendency is still upwards:&mdash;Two
incomplete sets of “The Snob,” ten numbers and
thirteen numbers, 1829-30, fetched at Sotheby’s
(Parlane &amp; Dasent) £89. The eleven numbers
complete, with seventeen numbers of the “Gownsman,”
sold at the Mansfield-Mackenzie sale, 1889,
for £25.</p>

<p>“The Fox and the Cat,” final proof-sheets of a
story apparently intended for the <i>Cornhill Magazine</i>,
but never published, revised by the author,
with numerous corrections and additions in his
autograph, sold by Sotheby’s in March 1897 (Rare
Books and MSS.) for £45, bought by Messrs. Smith,
Elder, &amp; Co.</p>

<p>The price of the first editions of Sir Walter Scott<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>’s
novels have been long in rising, but good fresh
copies fetch a good price now.</p>

<p>The most remarkable price for a three-volume
novel was obtained in July 1897 at Sotheby’s (Jack,
Halliday, &amp;c.), when the first edition of “Jane
Eyre” sold for seventeen guineas.</p>

<p>The question naturally occurs, Will such prices
as this continue? but it is a question very difficult
to answer. All that can be said is, that in this class
of books there is the most uncertainty as to the
high prices being sustained.</p>

<p>Depreciation is a factor which must be taken into
consideration, but it is not at present very widespread.
It is quite easy to understand why editions
of the classics and Thomas Hearne’s editions of
“Chronicles,” &amp;c., have gone down in price,
because the publication of superior texts has
partially superseded them; but one can scarcely
explain why the set of “Byzantine Historians”
should fall so much in price, for these ponderous
volumes have not been superseded. At the Hamilton
sale in 1884 a fine large paper set of these
“Historians,” 1645-1777, eighteen volumes in red
morocco by Ruelle, and five in calf, only brought
£4, 10s.</p>

<p>Mezeray’s <i>Histoire de France</i>, 3 vols. folio, bound
in blue morocco by Derome, which sold formerly
for £105, only sold for £33 at the Beckford
sale.</p>

<p>A large paper set of Hearne’s Works, bound in
red morocco, was bought at Mead’s sale for fifty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
guineas by an ancestor of Meerman the bibliographer.
It continued at the Hague with Meerman’s
library until the sale of the latter in 1822,
when it was bought by a London bookseller for
£200. Pickering purchased it, and sold it to
Hanrott for £500; at his sale in 1836 it was bought
by the Duke of Buccleuch for £400. At Watson
Taylor’s sale a set fetched £200. At the Beckford
sale, the set of Hearne’s Works were all on small
paper, with the exception of “Camden,” “Annales,”
1717, “Fordun’s Scoticronicon,” 1722, and “History
and Antiquities of Glastonbury,” 1722. The twenty-seven
lots only brought altogether £41, 10s.</p>


<p class="tb">In conclusion, there remain two points to lay
stress upon and to <span class="lock">reiterate&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(1) That price depends largely upon condition.
This every one connected with book-buying knows,
but the fact is almost entirely overlooked by those
who know but little of books. Constantly when a
very high price is announced in the papers some
person finds that he has a copy of the identical
book, for which he expects to obtain an identical
price, and he cannot understand when he is told
that his copy is practically valueless, because it is
in bad condition.</p>

<p>If a book is unique, he who wants it must take it
as it is, and make the best of the missing leaves,
the worm-holes, or the stained pages; but if several
copies still exist, it will be found that the price of
the bad copy bears no proportion to that of the
good one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>(2) The forger is abroad whenever prices rule
high. We have seen how facsimiles have been sold
as the originals, and bindings have often been
doctored, Maioli’s and Grolier’s being manufactured
for the ever greedy demand. Fortunately,
however cleverly the frauds may be produced, the
expert is pretty sure to notice something that makes
him suspicious, and suspicion will soon be turned
to certainty; but the public are easily gulled by that
to which they are unaccustomed.</p>

<p>Groliers may be imitated to deceive even the
expert, but in respect to more elaborate toolings,
such as those of Le Gascon, we are safe, because
to imitate these successfully would cost so great
an expenditure of time, that the forgery would be
worth almost as much as the original.</p>

and Typography of William Caxton” (1863); but there have been
many sales since the publication of his great work, and particulars of
these are given chiefly from two valuable articles, entitled <i>Caxtoniana</i>,
by Mr. Frederic Norgate, which were published in <i>The Library</i>, Nos. 8
and 9 (August and September 1889). That accurate bibliographer
has kindly allowed the author to see and use his manuscript corrections
and additions to these articles.</p></div>

Companion,” are worth quoting here, more particularly as that
Shakesperian commentator gives his opinion of what was a high price
for the first folio: “I have repeatedly met with thin flakes of pie-crust
between the leaves of our author. These unctuous fragments,
remaining long in close confinement, communicated their grease to
several pages deep on each side of them.... Most of the first folios
now extant are known to have belonged to ancient families resident in
the country. Since our breakfasts have become less gross, our favourite
authors have escaped with fewer injuries.... I claim the merit of
being the first commentator on Shakespeare who strove with becoming
seriousness to account for the present stains that disgrace the earliest
folio edition of his plays, which is now become the most expensive
single book in our language; for what other English volume without
plates, and printed since the year 1600, is known to have sold, more
than once, for £35, 14s.?”</p></div>
